Many of our veterans still call her 'Hanoi Jane' thanks to her radio broadcasts, which attempted to shame American troops," Kelly said on the air. "She posed on an anti-aircraft gun used to shoot down our pilots. She called our POW's 'hypocrites and liars' and referred to their torture as understandable. Even she had to apologize years later for that gun picture, but not for the rest of it."</p><p>Fonda said Wednesday night on <strong><a href=#>"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert"</a></strong> that the picture Kelly was referring to is one of her biggest regrets in life, and explained she sparked all of that backlash accidentally during her 1972 trip to Hanoi.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:40430d41-f34b-5905-95ea-b69cfaab90b2 data-container-ref=toofab:article:5c852327-4564-5a04-8861-ce7ed197fae2 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/b5/5by4/2018/01/22/b5028b4ea0a75e4995b9e4e8c19b6bd8_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">NBC/Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Twitter Roasts Megyn Kelly for Bringing 'Hanoi Jane' Into Her Plastic Surgery War with Jane Fonda</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"I sat on an anti-aircraft gun in North Vietnam. I wasn't even thinking what I was doing," she said. "And photographs were taken and that image went out, and the image makes it seem like I was against our soldiers, which was never the case."</p><p>"But that image is there, and I will go to my grave regretting that, and I knew right away that was wrong," she said, but added she does not "regret going to North Vietnam."</p><p>Although the picture made her a traitor in the eyes of many Americans and politicians, she's also credited for exposing the government's secret bombing of the country's dike system. "I'm proud of that, because I think it saved a lot of lives," she told Colbert.</p><p>Fonda also became famous for her popular instructional exercise videos, which started in 1982 with "Jane Fonda's Original Workout." She surprised Colbert with this fun fact: She only produced those to raise money for her activist organization, The Campaign for Economic Democracy.</p><p>"California's huge, it took a lot of money to have this organization, which did absolutely great things," she said. "And it was during a recession and I had to figure out, I gotta start a business that can make money for the organization, and it was the workout. And all of the money for the workout went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy."</p><p>Watch that entire interview below:</p><a class="media-link image-block__link js-track-link" href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/d4/o/2018/04/11/d47519e4d1e75e11a5805f0bf2cec68e_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlfnl7j3Jma2hfn66vsYyfpqeckWK2r3nFoq2eZZGYwbR5z6WYrKyZmHq0wdGgnKuxXZ2utbHSZqCtZaKatLOx062gp59dq7amwM2apGaomKTBsHnSrZypoJWjeqS7y5ucq6xf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./20-mind-blowing-facts-about-raglan-castle.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>20 Mind-blowing Facts About Raglan Castle</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kayla-maisonet-parents-ethnicity-age-ariana-greenblatt-boyfriend-dating-movies-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Kayla Maisonet?
