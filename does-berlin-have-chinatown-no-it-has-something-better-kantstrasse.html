And while cuisine from Greece, Spain, Lebanon and India is all on offer, this is where the first Chinese restaurant in the German capital, Tianjin Fandian, opened 100 years ago.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Since then, the street and the surrounding area have become home to an intercultural and intergenerational East Asian community, with a cast that includes affluent Chinese and Japanese students, Korean-born political activists and tofu makers and, more recently, economic migrants from Hong Kong and Taiwan.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/09/08/342e46c9-51a3-40b6-b22d-34928e1d6c11_30b7e614.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Kantstrasse is a unique space, which, for me, really stands for west Berlin,” says Kimiko Suda, a sociologist, Sinologist and anti-racism researcher from western Germany who has lived in Berlin since the 1999.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s a symbolic area and one in which everyone goes out. It’s not what people in some parts of mainstream German society call an ‘ethnic enclave’, which is how other areas are sometimes known in a derogatory way.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Kantstrasse is a really popular area within mainstream German society, and it’s also an important meeting point for the Taiwanese, Chinese, Korean and Japanese communities.”</p>According to Erich Gütinger, historian and author of The History of the Chinese in Germany (2004), while there are records of <a class="e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-1ankfgb ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Chinese migration</span></a> to Germany in the 1820s, it was in the late 19th century that Chinese students – impressed by the European nation’s military might and scientific and philosophical advancements – started to arrive.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Many of these students studied at Berlin’s Technical University, a prestigious public institution offering classes in science and engineering.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/09/08/95d158b5-03e4-4d31-a3f1-23921e0c94ef_86f51601.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">With the Chinese embassy, a major railway station and the university all close to Kantstrasse, writer Frank Hoffmann says the street became “specifically for the upper and middle class, a hang-out for elegantly dressed Asian students from mostly wealthy, upper-class families”, with Japanese students also among this early cohort.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A community of students soon started to form, with official directory records showing that a Chinese Students’ Association existed in the city as early as 1902.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This, says Gütinger, grew to have about 300 members as well as an office at Kantstrasse 118 in the 1920s. (Political tensions back home impacted relations between these young students, with a reported clash in August 1925 between supporters of the Kuomintang and Communist movements.)</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Public transport was already developed in the area and it was very convenient for them to live in and around Kantstrasse to go to their lessons.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/09/08/3412fe1d-2bb2-4630-94eb-e629c95183de_30b7e614.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“These students were in a small room but that didn’t matter much to them. What mattered was their food. And while they could cook for themselves, what they wanted was to eat together in a restaurant.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And so the Tianjin Fandian opened at Kantstrasse 130b in 1923.</p>During the years of <a class="e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-1ankfgb ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">the Third Reich</span></a>, between 1933 and 1945 when the Nazis were in power, Berlin was also home to a small group of Koreans. One famous figure from this period was An Pong-gun.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">An was an activist who, according to Hoffmann’s 2015 book, Berlin Koreans and Pictured Koreans, “must be given credit for introducing Korean fairy tales, classical literature, and short stories to Germans, and educating the general public about the Korean situation on lecture tours through all parts of the country”.</p>Alongside his activism against the <a class="e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-1ankfgb ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Japanese occupation of Korea</span></a>, An ran a highly profitable tofu business. In 1934, he and his German wife moved to Kantstrasse 132.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hoffmann writes how the street had been developing under East Asian influence, then featuring China-Haus, a shop selling imported Chinese goods at No 130, and three more Chinese restaurants.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/09/08/68b98f09-aaeb-4d5e-90e5-43579ff419f4_43e205bb.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tianjin Fandian had by then “long been known as the meeting point and hang-out for Asian students and intellectuals to debate politics”, with a sign at the entrance that read, “Japs and Brits are hereby kindly informed that we cannot guarantee your safety in this restaurant”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As subjects of the Japanese Empire, a German ally, Koreans were indirectly protected by the Nazis’ so-called Aryan race law and were therefore treated differently from the Chinese. As Hoffmann discovered, there were several Koreans who were close to the Nazis “while simultaneously working with and for the Japanese regime”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Gütinger says from this period onwards Kantstrasse and Berlin in general saw a dip in the number of migrants, which was reflective of Germany more widely.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“At the time, China had two rival governments and it was not clear how to deal with the Nazis,” he says. “The only ones who had very clear opposition to the Nazis were the Chinese Communists, many of them petty traders.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“And so during that period many had to leave Germany. Either they were deported or they moved to neighbouring countries like Poland, Russia, or in some cases, back home.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/09/08/6b66f27b-be8d-4a06-b75e-69b5459867ad_65742102.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Following Germany’s defeat and subsequent carving up between Allied powers, Berlin was further divided along political lines by the Berlin Wall, in 1961.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The city remained politically and geographically bifurcated until reunification in 1990, following the collapse of the Soviet Union.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ting and his family came to Germany from Taiwan via Madrid, in Spain, in 1968, when he was 13 years old. His father found work as a chef while they settled into their new life.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One of his roles as a young man was as president of an association that supported new arrivals from Taiwan with visa and language help, and hosted cultural programmes showing Taiwanese films.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Berlin back then was an interesting place and Kantstrasse didn’t have as many [mainland] Chinese people as today,” says Ting. “Back then there were more people from Taiwan.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/09/08/e4e6495d-7483-497c-b4d8-5ae500c0cc82_cf94ef4d.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Suda says economic liberalisation in China in the 1970s and ’80s led to more disposable income and an increase in overseas travel, “while for people in Hong Kong, it was different because it was easier for them to travel to the UK and then onwards”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It was this route that K. Wong’s family took in the ’70s to reach West Berlin. Today, she manages Aroma, a restaurant serving authentic Cantonese fare such as dim sum and sui gao soup.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Warm and welcoming in person, she says that while she is happy to share her story, she is not keen to include her real name or picture, preferring to keep a low profile.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Following her birth in London, Wong’s parents decided to move to West Berlin in search of economic opportunities. They ran a series of restaurants, which they gave up over the years to focus on Aroma.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Located at Kantstrasse 35, it is a few doors down from Lon Men’s and the Cantonese restaurant Good Friends, at No 30, all of which opened in the early 2000s. The three are the street’s most well-known and established East Asian restaurants and Wong says there is a friendly atmosphere among the restaurant owners.</p>A lot more Asian businesses have opened here in recent years and I think this is going to continueHsien-Kuo Ting<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The parents of the owner of Good Friends and my parents were the first generation from Hong Kong to arrive here and our families know each other well,” Wong says. Despite being of the second generation of restaurateurs within the family, she doesn’t see a third emerging.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Her children, she says, work in offices and it’s not easy to find new chefs. “The rents are also rising,” she says. “It is not clear what will happen in the future.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We get a lot of Asian students and young German tourists who may come here after a visit to the J-store,” says Kame owner Machiko Yamashita, who opened the cafe seven years ago just off Kantstrasse, her art student vibe reflected in its cosy atmosphere.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Being among this younger crowd is part of the street’s new appeal for Jannik Starkarat, a 34-year-old software developer and Kantstrasse regular.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/09/08/23f0d9fd-3e7a-4860-acf2-92ecb566a6ce_1e61491e.jpg>Starkarat used to come with his family as a child and continues to eat here. He has a long list of favourite dishes and places – fong wong rolls and tofu with pepper and salt at Good Friends, sushi at Kuchi Kant, spring rolls with minced chicken at Thai restaurant Chon Thong, and cheese dak-galbi (<a class="e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-1ankfgb ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">spicy stir-fried chicken</span></a>) at Korean eatery Han BBQ.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Seeing a younger generation is what I also like about coming here,” says Starkarat over hot and sour soup at Good Friends. “It attracts students and young people who have a good job and are well educated, so it’s a class thing, a fusion between being racialised and privileged – people like myself.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He says that since the area is centrally located and in an upmarket part of west Berlin, the gentrification impacting other parts of the city, in particular areas with historical diaspora communities, is unlikely to threaten Kantstrasse. Looking out onto the street outside, he motions with his hand, “There’s not much to fix around here.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yamashita, meanwhile, hopes to see more of a gastronomic community growing here in the future.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Over at Lon Men’s, Ting says he is finding it difficult to hire new chefs but the few he currently employs are mostly from Hong Kong, Taiwan and mainland China. “There is a reunion here,” he quips, stirring the stew as diners start to arrive.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/09/08/0c2e5252-d300-4fb8-9455-7b15789fd1d6_ac3cc276.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ting is preparing to retire at the end of the year, with the eldest of his three sons, Ido, taking the reins while he and his wife split their time between Taiwan and Berlin. So whatever happens with the other Kantstrasse businesses as contemporary tastes evolve, Ting, at least, will see a third generation of restaurateurs in the family.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Lon men means ‘dragon gate’ and the dragon is my father’s Chinese animal,” says Ting. “He is 101 years old and still alive in Taipei so I hope I have some more years ahead.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“A lot more Asian businesses have opened here in recent years and I think this is going to continue,” he says, taking a sip of the stew. “I’d like to see dining culture from Asia expand from here across Berlin.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZL2wv9NmpJqfka%2B2r7GOpaann12nsqKw0miYq6yZmLmme5JramxwZWd8pbvErGSbnaKhtq95x5qtnmWTnbavrdOorqdlnqR6qsCMoZisZaOkuqbAx6KloGWSmsG1sdFmopqmpKjBs63SrJw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./fashion-watches-are-having-moment-demnas-balenciaga-choker-fendis-mary-jane-pumps-luxury-brands-are.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fashion watches are having a moment from Demnas Balenciaga choker to Fendis Mary Jane pump</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./alfonso-lincoln-ribeiro-jr.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Alfonso Lincoln Ribeiro Jr - Bio, Net Worth, Height, Single, Facts</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amal-clooney-mob-wife-trend-cream-fur-coat.html>Amal Clooney Elevates the Mob Wife Trend in a Cream Fur Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./demolition-underway-at-washington-elementary-davenport.html>Demolition underway at Washington Elementary, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iowa-man-killed-in-head-on-crash.html>Iowa man killed in head-on crash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./style-edit-richard-milles-technically-ambitious-new-rm-30-01-automatic-luxury-watch-was-inspired.html>Style Edit: Richard Milles technically ambitious new RM 30-01 Automatic luxury watch was inspired</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./463481-what-happened-frankie-lons-life-story-death.html>What happened to Frankie Lons?
