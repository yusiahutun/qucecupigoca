So, is Black Ops 3 cross platform?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6c7e19f3fcb3a207.jpg><p class=align-left>Is Black Ops 3 cross platform? Black Ops 3 is one of the most popular video games in the world. Several platforms, including PC and Xbox, support <a href=#>the game</a>. Here is everything you need to know about this game.</p><h2>What is Black Ops 3?</h2><p class=align-left>Black Ops 3 is a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">first-person shooter video game</a>. It is the third instalment in Activision’s Call of Duty Black Ops <a href=#>series</a>. It was developed by Treyarch and published by Activision for PS4, PS5, Xbox, and PC.</p><p class=align-left>The game was released in November 2015, and it was considered a success by both critics and fans alike. It continues the aspects of futuristic warfare. Different forces are engaged in a war using robotic drones and high-efficiency super soldiers. It boasted a well-balanced multiplayer mode.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5aecf2491ae2d562.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Best Now.gg Roblox alternatives and similar gaming websites</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Interestingly, Black Ops 3 was released when the Xbox and PS4 platforms had existed for more than two years. Nonetheless, it was a commercial success, and it marked another great year in the books for Activision.</p><p class=align-left>Black Ops 3 runs on all major platforms, such as:</p><ul><li>PlayStation 3, 4, and 5</li><li>Xbox 360 & One</li><li>Xbox Series X|S</li><li>Microsoft Windows</li><li>MacOS</li></ul><h2>Is Black Ops 3 cross platform?</h2><p class=align-left><a href=#>Multiplatform games</a> allow players to interact with other players in different scenarios. For instance, you can play the game online with people who play the same game but have a different platform. This is done by comparing Xbox One, PlayStation 5, and PC players in one game.</p><p class=align-left>The cross-platform game feature is still new, and not all games support it. However, many developers are working to incorporate cross-platform games into their upcoming releases. As a result, gamers will interact with players from different platforms while playing multiplayer online.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/846c8a5bb3562423.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Minecraft characters ranked according to their popularity</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Unfortunately, Black Ops 3 is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">not a cross platform</a>. Therefore, it means that if one player is playing on PS4 and the other player is using Xbox One, they cannot play together. But you can enjoy playing multiplayer with your friends if they are all on the same platform.</p><p class=align-left>It was with the launch of Modern Warfare in 2019 that <a href=#>Call of Duty</a> first went cross-platform compatible. Therefore, with Black Ops 3 having launched in 2015, there is no way it could have been released with crossplay features on board.</p><p class=align-left>But can PS4 play with PS5 BO3? Yes, Black Ops 3 supports cross-platform games between PS4 and PS. Therefore, if you have a PS4 and your friend has a PS5, you can both enjoy playing multiplayer together.</p><h2>How can you join your friend on Black Ops 3 for PC?</h2><p class=align-left>Joining your friend on Black Ops 3 for Personal Computer is quite easy. You can utilise the Quick Join feature. The Quick Join area is found on the right side of the screen on the Main Menu.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/772ebd9036826344.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The 10 best Canadian hockey players of all time as of 2023</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Any friends currently playing the game will be visible in this area. To make use of the Quick Join feature, highlight and select the name of the friend you would like to join.</p><h3>Why is Black Ops 3 not a cross platform?</h3><p class=align-left>There are various reasons why this video game is not a cross platform game. Some of these reasons include;</p><p class=align-left>The game has different features in different settings. Therefore, players playing on the same platform will not enjoy the full experience.</p><p class=align-left>It is better for game developers and publishers to sell their products on one channel rather than many, as it reduces production costs.</p><p class=align-left>Some game consoles offer special games that are not available on some platforms. Some have higher-quality graphics and resolution than others.</p><h2>Does Black Ops III support split-screen play over Xbox Live or PlayStation?</h2><p class=align-left>Black Ops III supports two-player split-screen online play in Multiplayer or zombie game modes. Xbox One and PS4 support split-screen for up to four players in Multiplayer, but only in local play. However, Xbox 360 and PS3 do not support split-screen.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8efd862d50097aac.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 best reality shows on DStv that you should watch</span></p></a><h2>What are cross platform games on Black Ops 3?</h2><p class=align-left>There are no cross platform games on Black Ops 3. However, Black Ops 3 is like another Call of Duty game but with much-improved graphics.</p><p class=align-left>Is Black Ops 3 cross platform? Unfortunately, this video game is not. Cross-platform support is becoming more important in the <a href=#>world</a> of video games. Luckily, developers are incorporating it in new releases for gamers to interact with players from different platforms as they play multiplayer.</p><p class=align-left>Tuko.co.ke also published an article answering the question, 'Is there a <a href=#>McDonald's in Kenya</a>?'
