He served eight years as the 2nd Ward Alderman for the city until 2005. In 2021, he was elected as the 6th Ward Alderman. Pat was also the former President of the Council on Community Services and also served as President of the Moline Preservation society. His co-workers and friends describe him as selfless.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2023/12/Ald.-Pat-OBrien.jpg><p>In a news release from Moline Mayor Sangeetha Rayapati, O’Brien was remembered for his life of public service:</p><p>It is with deep shock and sadness that we wish to inform the Moline community of the passing of Alderperson Pat O’Brien. Pat was a fierce community advocate, lifting up the causes he cared so much about, such as addressing poverty, environmental issues and workers’ rights not only in word, but also in deed. His multiple terms of service as alderperson, as well as his time as a county board member, are a testament to his commitment to these ideals and his commitment to each of us. His life of public service will be a lasting reminder to all of us of how to care for our neighbors and our community. We were privileged to know and work alongside him.</p>Mayor Sangeetha Rayapati<p>An email from Moline City Administrator Bob Vitas was sent to all city employees and elected officials:</p><p>Today we are saddened to learn that our dear colleague, friend and Alderman Pat O’Brien has passed away. We will always remember Pat for his leadership, the guidance he shared with others, and his great love for the City of Moline. Pat truly dedicated his life to public service and was always selfless in looking after the best interests of all those he served through the decades.&nbsp; Our deepest heartfelt sympathies go out to his family and dear friends. May he rest in peace and may his memory be eternal.</p>Bob Vitas<p>“Pat was generous. He was special and he will be missed,” Illinois State Treasurer Michael Frerichs said. “There was rarely a conversation we’ve had where Pat wasn’t talking about how to help those who are most vulnerable, where Pat wasn’t talking about how to help working people. These were his real passions and that’s the legacy he’s going to leave.”</p><p>“His legacy is of service to people,” Former Illinois Congressman Phil Hare said. “I’ve never heard him raise his voice to anybody. If you need help, he’ll get you the help.”</p><p>“Pat was dedicated towards helping our office reach more people. Giving them greater opportunities,” Frerichs said. “But in his spare time, he found ways to serve his community and found areas to volunteer. He was always looking to help other people.”</p><p>O’Brien also worked for Bethany for Children and Family Services in Moline, where he won a statewide award for his financial literacy program coursework. Bill Steinhauser, president and CEO for the nonprofit, spoke highly on O’Brien’s energy and passion. “He believed in other people,” Steinhauser said. “He believed in the community. He believed in the Quad Cities and Moline and invested time, his energy, into creating solutions for people but also helping them create solutions for themselves. We need to follow his example, and perhaps that’s our best way of saying we miss Pat by doing what he did in this community and doing it in his memory.”</p><p>There is no word yet on a cause of death or plans for memorials.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46lppyZnGK7psPSaKearF2kr7O1xKdkpqecnrumeZWtn2avkaexbq3LnZyrpZGjeqW1xKxm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./fosters-recap-season-4-episode-10-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Fosters Summer Finale Recap: In Too Deep</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./otterbox-symmetry-vs-commuter.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>OtterBox Symmetry vs. Commuter: What Are the Differences?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amal-clooney-mob-wife-trend-cream-fur-coat.html>Amal Clooney Elevates the Mob Wife Trend in a Cream Fur Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./demolition-underway-at-washington-elementary-davenport.html>Demolition underway at Washington Elementary, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iowa-man-killed-in-head-on-crash.html>Iowa man killed in head-on crash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./style-edit-richard-milles-technically-ambitious-new-rm-30-01-automatic-luxury-watch-was-inspired.html>Style Edit: Richard Milles technically ambitious new RM 30-01 Automatic luxury watch was inspired</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./463481-what-happened-frankie-lons-life-story-death.html>What happened to Frankie Lons?
