"They all had their guns on me. They were telling me to 'get on the ground, get on the ground.' So I got on the ground, listened to them, and they put me handcuffs."</p><p>After being treated in hospital, he was cited for criminal mischief and criminal trespassing.</p><p>"It was crazy to do what I did," he said.
