With star-studded roles and an impressive portrayal as Killmonger in Black Panther and Adonis Creed in the Creed series, we’re dying to know <a href=# rel=noopener>who Michael B. Jordan is dating</a>&nbsp;now.</p><p>The actor constantly pokes fun at his <a href=# id=auto-tag_dating data-tag=dating>dating</a> life. Before his relationship with Lori Harvey, he said that dating life is so different as an actor in an interview with<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"> GQ.</a> “My career is awesome. It is going great. There’s other places in my life that I’m fucking lacking at. I’m very mature and advanced in a lot of areas of life. Dating may not be one of ’em. My personal life is not. I don’t really know what dating is.” He continued saying that whenever there’s an interaction with a fellow actor, the speculation might be more than what’s actually happening. “So then they’re going to talk about you, they’re going to find out who you are. They’re gonna find out what your Instagram is, they’re going to find us in that. And all the fan club and everybody else is going to find out who you are, and now you and I are forever associated with one another. So now, how do you go anywhere normal, chill, just getting to know somebody that you just met, that you may not—may or may not—hit it off at all? That part of dating is tough.” Though, he assured us, “now, I’m not saying options aren’t there. I’m not saying that. But as far as, like, the nuance of dating, it’s just not the same. I’m just going to keep trying to work on myself and build this empire.”</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/lily-singh-production-company.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/pedro-pascal-1.png><p>When he hosted Saturday Night Live on January 29, 2023, he talked about being on dating apps in <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">his monologue</a> with the whole cast (and world)<a href=# rel=noopener> swooning over him</a>. “I just directed my very first movie, ‘Creed III.’ Right after that, I went through my very first public breakup.

Weeks before the SNL monologue about his singleness, the Sun reported that the two allegedly met after Michael bought stakes in the English football club AFC Bournemouth and frequently flies across the pod. A source told <a class=class href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Sun</a>: ‘It’s early stages but Amber and Michael are really keen on each other.” According to the source, his friends say his “head has been turned” by Amber and the pair have enjoyed multiple chats. “It’s early stages but Amber and Michael are really keen on each other.

Jordan’s latest long-term relationship was with model&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener> Lori Harvey</a>. The two were first linked in November 2020 and made their red carpet debut at the 2022 Vanity Fair Oscars After Party on March 27. When they first went public with their romance, Michael spoke to <a href=# rel=noopener>The Hollywood Reporter</a>&nbsp;on December 1, 2021, about his relationship with Lori. “When I was younger, I don’t know if I could have handled the onslaught of opinions and being picked apart, and also being conscious of what the other person’s going to go through,” he told the magazine.</p><p>He continued, “It takes a special person to deal with that. There’s a premeditated planning of staying out of the way [of the public eye] that sometimes kills spontaneity and intimacy. I wanted to take that away and give this the best chance it had, in this weird world that we live in, to be somewhat normal. Long story short, I think it’s just the timing of everything. It was the right time for me.” He added, “Yeah. I’m happy.”</p><p class=big_first_letter>A source close to the couple confirmed to People that the model and the&nbsp;Creed actor have broken up on June 4, 2022. <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">They told Entertainment Tonight</a><span>&nbsp;that the two are still grasping their feelings amid the breakup. “Michael and Lori are both completely heartbroken. They still love each other.” The source continued, “Michael matured a lot over the course of their relationship and was ready to commit for the long term. He let down his guard with her, opening up emotionally in a romantic relationship for the first time. They had great times together and brought out the best in each other.”</span></p><p>On June 6, 2022, another source told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a>&nbsp;the exact reason why the daughter of&nbsp;Family Feud&nbsp;host Steve Harvey wanted to break up. Lori, 25, and Michael, 35, were not able to agree on what worked in their relationship.&nbsp;“[She] wasn’t ready to commit. She is very focused on her career. [She] realized that they weren’t on the same page [while they] were making plans for their future.” The source added, “She still wants to have fun and be free. Michael is a great guy. She is sad that their relationship didn’t work out, but she is moving on.”</p><h2>Snoh Aalegra (2019)</h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p>Michael B.

He disputed the rumors in a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">GQ interview</a>. “A lot of Black fans were feeling like, ‘Oh, my God, he should have been with a Black woman’ and that whole thing,” he adds. “I get it, but on the other hand it’s, like, relax. You know – it’s 2015. It’s okay! People can like one another, not necessarily from the same history or culture or whatever the f— it is.” He said of his friendship with the 818 Tequila founder, “Kendall’s a friend of mine, you know.

It’s so weird when you’re walking somewhere and you get caught in a picture – all of a sudden y’all are dating. Why is that?” questioned Jordan. “I don’t watch a lot of TV. All that extra stuff, that’s not me. I’m about my work, my business, my friends, my family. I have a good time when I’m supposed to. But other than that, I’m not into all that extra drama.”</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ShoppingNewsletter_onsitegraphic.png alt="StyleCaster Shopping Newsletter Sign Up" width=670 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><i>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
