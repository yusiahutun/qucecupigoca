News</strong></a>, saying she's never actually asked to be on the show. This seems like a pretty strong pitch, though, of her interest. It's not asking, technically, but it's not not asking, either.</p><p>Spelling hinted at current and past financial woes on the podcast when she revealed that she once had to have an estate sale when she wound up with an $80,000 bill for 50 storage units.</p><p>"I was probably broke again," she quipped, saying that this happened back in 2006. Now, after her family had to vacate their home due to toxic mold, Spelling said she's got stuff in storage unites again, "that I can't now pay for."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:1e2398a2-2560-4654-b0b9-c4f235a16693 data-container-ref=toofab:article:f9f70d8b-21be-4743-9cd4-067b566873cf data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/42/5by4/2024/04/02/42e562105e2b4429957af53b1e8253bf_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Tori Spelling's Daughter 'Shamed' By Classmates for Living in RV: 'Thought You Were Homeless'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"Anyway, I think it's time for another estate sale, right?" she said. At least this time, per her <a href=#><strong>previous podcast episode</strong></a>, she only has four of them that she's sifting through and trying to whittle down to a more manageable size.</p><p>"I'm a hoarder, you guys! Hi, my name's Tori and I'm a hoarder. There I said it," Spelling told her listeners, while sitting inside one of her storage units after being let in by a locksmith. "I always tell people, 'I'm not a hoarder. I'm a collector.'"</p><p>"I have all my kids' memories. I have everything from my 18-year marriage, everything until, I guess, a year ago when we had to escape the house with mold and everything was put into storage," she explained.</p><p>The daughter of late film and television producer Aaron Spelling admitted that she no longer "had the money" to pay for the units which hold their "whole lives."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:78c62654-25cb-4738-b46a-2b24d925751d data-container-ref=toofab:article:f9f70d8b-21be-4743-9cd4-067b566873cf data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/6d/5by4/2024/04/01/6d99d6ebfcb54e92a3e0ec573c7f6815_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Tori Spelling Reveals Dean McDermott Comment That Finally Led to Divorce Filing</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Spelling thanked a friend for stopping the units from going up for auction, which Spelling explained is what happens when you don't pay for your storage units.</p><p>"I don't want sympathy, but I was taught, or I wasn't taught how to function in the real world and I'm doing the best I can," Spelling admitted. "I want to tell you something that's not going to be shocking. I'm not good with money. I suck with money. I didn't even know how to write a check until I was in my 40s."</p><p>One thing that would certainly help the actress out in her current financial situation would be a lucrative role hanging out with her friends on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. She'd probably even invite some of her 90210 pals along from time to time.</p><p>This is not us asking, technically, that she join the show, but it's also not not us asking, if you know what we mean.</p><a id=gallery-link-9717dcbb-8907-40ee-bc7b-b42d20c0ad61 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:9717dcbb-8907-40ee-bc7b-b42d20c0ad61 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:f9f70d8b-21be-4743-9cd4-067b566873cf data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/49/4by3/2024/04/15/4934fa5fe9164f59b6d5a489e9a0363a_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j21ma2lfqbyztYysp56knJ67qHnWmqWtq12WwKx5wKebsmWTpLWmuoywn7JlnqTBbr7HqJmhZZOWwrSxjKKkZpqipLimew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./author.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>deb Page 88 smitten kitchen</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./laura-ingle-journalist.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Laura Ingle dating?
