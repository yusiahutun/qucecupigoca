Ever since the regal drama, loosely based on history, hit the streaming giant, <a href=#>royal</a> fans can’t get enough. Season five was one of its top releases, with the first episode being watched by almost three million viewers in the first week alone. The second release also drew in the same amount. Although season six topped it’s the site’s own chart, it wasn’t as huge as the penultimate episodes. But, since its 2016 debut, more than 73 million users have watched The Crown – but <a href=#>Prince William</a> may not have seen every episode like hardcore fans, apparently.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-prince-william-rolls-his-eyes-over-the-crown>Prince William ‘rolls his eyes’ over The Crown</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/Screenshot-2024-01-19-at-16.33.40-1024x528.png><p><a href=#>Prince Harry</a> has made his thoughts clear on the show, even discussing it on national TV.</p><p>During a segment with James Corden on The Late Late Show, the Duke of Sussex told the comedian it doesn’t grind his gears.</p><p>Harry said: “They don’t pretend to be news. It’s fiction. But it’s loosely based on the truth”.</p><p>Then when he was on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, he was asked again if he watched it. The 39-year-old had been invited on to talk about his upcoming memoir, Spare.</p><p>He still kept the conversation chilled, though.</p><p>“Yes I have actually watched The Crown, the older stuff and the more recent stuff.”</p><p>Stephen then asked him: “Do you fact check it while you watch it?”</p><p>Then Harry grinned and joked: “Um, yes I do actually”, which made the audience laugh.</p><p>When it comes to Prince William’s feelings about The Crown, he’s kept it close to his chest.</p><p>But now, Robert Hardman, in his new book, has said a palace aide confided in the author on how he doesn’t like it.</p><p>Hardman, in his book, Charles III. New King. New Court. The Inside Story, says the Prince of Wales “rolls his eyes” over the series. However, if it is brought up in conversation, he doesn’t complain about it. This is because he doesn’t want the Netflix show to get any more publicity that it already has.</p><p>A close aide told Hardman allegedly: “The Prince knows about it. He rolls his eyes when people say that ‘it’s just drama.’</p><p>“He knows what they [Netflix] are doing. Yet he will not give it any greater publicity by complaining. He doesn’t like the idea of being seen a complainer all the time.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-william-spoke-out-against-diana-interview>William spoke out against Diana interview</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1423734642-1024x725.jpg><p>In the latest season, one expert said <a href=#>The Crown focusing on ‘Prince William mania’ </a>would have affected Harry. Although, awkwardly, it focused on a <a href=#>previous girlfriend of the Prince as well</a>. Even if Prince William hasn’t revealed his true thoughts on The Crown, he has spoken out before about TV.</p><p>Following a BBC report over <a href=#>Princess Diana</a>‘s 1995 Panorama interview, concluding it was obtained using deception, the brothers spoke out about the ordeal. They slammed journalist Martin Bashir for attempting to gain the People’s Princess confidence to get her to speak on camera.</p><p>William released his own statement, and said it should never be aired on <a href=#>TV</a> ever again.</p><p>The Prince of Wales said: “It is my view that the deceitful way the interview was obtained substantially influenced what my mother said. The interview was a major contribution to making my parents’ relationship worse and has since hurt countless others.</p><p>“It is my firm view that this Panorama program holds no legitimacy and should never be aired again. It effectively established a false narrative which, for over a quarter of a century, has been commercialized by the BBC and others.”</p><p>The 42-year-old continued, saying it brought “sadness” to know the BBC’s failures contributed to Diana’s ‘fear, paranoia and isolation’ in her final years – which he remembers.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2aGcLzRoqWcnV2stq24yJqkZqqfobm0eceiqmadqZrAbsPHnqWerpWnerS7zJ6mp51dl7%2BqusasZK6oXam1pnnCq6awpl8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-to-wear.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Wedges are back for spring/summer 2024 Shop the best</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./pianist-lang-langs-concert-hong-kong-disneyland-dream-come-true-chinese-keyboard-virtuoso.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Pianist Lang Langs concert at Hong Kong Disneyland a dream come true for Chinese keyboard v</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amal-clooney-mob-wife-trend-cream-fur-coat.html>Amal Clooney Elevates the Mob Wife Trend in a Cream Fur Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./demolition-underway-at-washington-elementary-davenport.html>Demolition underway at Washington Elementary, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iowa-man-killed-in-head-on-crash.html>Iowa man killed in head-on crash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./style-edit-richard-milles-technically-ambitious-new-rm-30-01-automatic-luxury-watch-was-inspired.html>Style Edit: Richard Milles technically ambitious new RM 30-01 Automatic luxury watch was inspired</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./463481-what-happened-frankie-lons-life-story-death.html>What happened to Frankie Lons?
