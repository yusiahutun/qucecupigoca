And while it may be very tempting to squeeze them out yourself, you can easily damage the skin and push the blackhead deeper inside the pore. So instead of picking and prodding, using a pore strip is a satisfying way to degunk pores and keep your skin clear.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When used correctly, pore strips are a safe and effective way to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>remove blackheads</a> instantly, as they are more gentle than using pressure and your fingers, according to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>Rachel Nazarian</a>, M.D., a New York City-based board-certified dermatologist. And we can't deny how oddly satisfying it is to examine all the gross gunk they pull out of your pores. Since pore strips should be used with care, we asked dermatologists how to select and safely use them.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With their advice, we compiled a list of 7 promising pore strips and sent nine testers to try them out in our lab and at home. Following the products' instructions, the testers rated each strip on ease of use, comfort, and efficacy. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Hero's Mighty Patch for the Nose</a> earned a perfect score and our Best Overall spot since there was no pain or irritation involved and it left our tester's skin poreless.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Whether you are looking for pore strips to implement into your regular routine or want to degunk for a special event, these are the best pore strips for the job.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-hero-cosmetics-mighty-patch-nose></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Hero Cosmetics Mighty Patch Nose</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Hero Cosmetics Mighty Patch Nose" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/5IXP3olxK0MnlDFH4aLIFaG_yko=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/mighty-patch-nose-pore-pimple-patches-9dc4555ff63a4381a8c3d1f2845f0fc0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Efficacy</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Irritation</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you are scarred by memories of painful pores strips that left your nose as red as Rudolph, let Hero's Mighty Patch change your mind. The product is more akin to the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>brand's pimple patches</a> than a traditional pore strip: Rather than using adhesive to pull out blackheads, it uses medical-grade hydrocolloid to gently absorb oil. It also helps reduce the size of pimples, so the strips are a good solution for whiteheads, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Rest assured you'll still get the gross-satisfaction that comes with a more traditional pore strip — the patch gradually whitens in color as it absorbs oil. "My skin was very smooth after taking it off," says our tester, who gave the product a perfect score. "It hurts a lot less than other pore strips, and once it's on it just feels like a bandaid." Like a true bandaid, the strips are very thin and sticky, so our tester found them a little tricky to put on.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One of our writers, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Lauren Rearick</a>, also <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>put the product to the test</a> and found it was a great solution for her oily nose, writing, "My nose is notoriously oily and after using the sticker for an entire week, I have definitely noticed a difference in this area of skin.

The strips feature hydrocolloid polymer technology, which absorbs the oil, dirt, and bacteria from inside pores, as well as the vitamin B-derived compound DMAE and vitamin A, which work together to prevent further blockage. The package comes with eight strips — four for the nose and four for other parts of the face.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Unlike other strips that work in a few minutes, the brand recommends wearing them overnight (or for at least six hours at a time) to really get a deep clean. Even after a few minutes of using these in the lab, our tester saw significant reduction in oil and blackheads, so she can only imagine how powerful they are after a full night — yet they were still gentle. "I didn't experience any irritation or redness, and it was an easy, painless removal process " says our tester.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Another tester used strips for the recommended time and was blown away. "After four to six hours of wear, the strip gently peels away to reveal all the horrifying gunk that's been sucked out of your pores. All it takes is one use to notice a significant difference."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shape: </strong>Nose and Face |<strong> Number of Strips: </strong>8 |<strong> Added Ingredients: </strong>Vitamin A, Hydrocolloid Polymer Technology</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-oversized-tonymoly-tako-pore-one-shot-nose-pack></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Oversized</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>TonyMoly Tako Pore One Shot Nose Pack</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="TonyMoly Tako Pore One Shot Nose Pack" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/k85z0uKjIAXjvFerNCp4uxR84JM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/tonymoly-tako-pore-one-shot-nose-pack-bbc80e3b98d843f0a9d8cc6fbc242617.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This TonyMoly pore strip can unclog more pores at once than others on this list, thanks to its unique oversized shape that fits your entire nose, including the area in between your eyebrows, which can be a blackhead magnet due to excess oil production in that area "I used this strip after already testing another nose strip to focus more on the forehead, but looking at the strip and my nose and forehead afterwards, it removed a lot of the sebaceous materials the other pore strip left behind," says our tester. "My nose felt super soft after using this strip and it definitely looked clearer."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Besides removing impurities in just 15 minutes, the strip also features a marine root-up complex that helps nourish, soothe, and shrink pores. Our tester did note that there was some residue left over after, but it was easy to wipe away revealing soft and smooth skin. She also loved how adorable the strip looked (like all TonyMoly products) — it forms a cute octopus on your face — making pore cleaning that much more fun.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shape: </strong>Nose and Forehead |<strong> Number of Strips: </strong>1 |<strong> Added Ingredients: </strong>Dead Sea Salt, Taurine, Black Peat Water</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-charcoal-ulta-charcoal-nose-strips></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Charcoal</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Ulta Charcoal Nose Strips</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Ulta Charcoal Nose Strips" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/nZCrLUL-x5VWP1a5ilfTDa6JPto=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ulta-charcoal-nose-strips-26f3fb820f174f909be81e5f6c63001f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Efficacy</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Irritation</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With all the beauty products that contain charcoal these days, it seems the ingredient and pore-declogging go hand-in-hand. "Because charcoal is highly absorbent, the idea is that when you put it on your skin, it will act as a micro sponge to trap the oil and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>sebum</a> on the surface of your skin," says board-certified dermatologist and co-founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="nofollow nocaes">BalmLabs</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nocaes>Robin Schaffran</a>, M.D.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This charcoal-infused strip from Ulta impressed our tester all around, especially when it came to the fit. " It's designed with small slits which allow the strip to fit snugly and contour my nose more than others," says our tester. "While wearing the strip, I felt no discomfort whatsoever. I could talk without noticing I had the strip on my nose. As I removed it, there was no discomfort at all," they add. Because the strip reached every angle, it pulled out small and large filaments alike on the top and sides of the nose, leaving our tester smooth and very satisfied. Plus, there was no redness — only a slight residue that easily came off with water.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shape: </strong>Nose |<strong> Number of Strips: </strong>8 |<strong> Added Ingredients: </strong>Charcoal, Aloe Vera, Witch Hazel</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-entire-face-formula-1006-down-to-the-pore-strips-pack></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Entire Face</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Formula 10.0.6 Down To the Pore Strips Pack</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Two Formula 10.0.6 Down To the Pore Strips Packs" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/dV8_-EQDNg750enlMs4Ge4IHceA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/formula-1006-down-to-the-pore-strips-pack-0d9eb2311cb1426b941978e5c4f258c6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Efficacy</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Irritation</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Blackheads don't just prey on your nose — they can form all over the face — so we love the convenience of this set that's made for the nose, chin, and forehead. The strips contain clay and witch hazel, which according to board-certified dermatologist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Dr. Kavita Mariwalla</a>, are two ingredients that help absorb oil and shrink pores.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Because you'll be using these all over your face, they should feel comfortable. "I'm used to strips that feel stiff and uncomfortable, but I would say this is a kinder, gentler pore strip," says our tester. "There was no redness, irritation, or tightness." Some pore strips can make you feel like a mummy, but our tester was able to talk and emote even with these on. She did slightly struggle with figuring out the correct placement on the forehead — the instructions could be clearer — but that was her only complaint.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shape: </strong>Nose, Chin, and Forehead |<strong> Number of Strips: </strong>8 |<strong> Added Ingredients: </strong>Witch Hazel, Clay, Charcoal</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-acne-patchology-breakout-box-3-in-1-acne-treatment-kit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Acne</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Patchology Breakout Box 3-in-1 Acne Treatment Kit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Patchology Breakout Box 3-in-1 Acne Treatment Kit" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/b69eR2AWDNaVmOkxZVjOwgoccLA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/patchology-breakout-box-3-in-1-acne-treatment-kit-9ff3769ef21a4c548600617d8a36547d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Dermstore</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Efficacy</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Irritation</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For those who are equally concerned about acne as blackheads, this kit is perfect. In addition to three nose strips, you get 24 hydrocolloid dots to absorb pus from whiteheads and 24 salicylic acid dots to bust up clogged pores and reduce inflammation. The stickers blended into our tester's skin, preventing her from touching and picking at blemishes. "I had a breakout just starting out when I tried these. After about three and half hours, the dot had absorbed all of the sebum surrounding the area," says our tester.

And in that time, the blend of witch hazel, clay, and aloe soothed and shrank her pores.

With their advice, we rounded up 14 promising products in a range of sizes and ingredients to suit different skin types and needs. Our nine testers then put these products to the test by replicating the process one would follow at home — cleansing their skin, then following the specific instructions on how to apply the strips. After waiting the recommended amount of time and removing each strip, they rated every product on a scale of 1 to 5 on ease of use, comfort, irritation, and how much gunk the strips actually removed. Once all the numbers were in, we narrowed down the original selection to the seven best pore strips.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Ingredients</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">All pore strips fundamentally function the same, except they can have different added ingredients, like vitamin A or witch hazel, to enhance the process. Witch hazel is used to soothe irritated and inflamed skin, while vitamin A (aka retinol) speeds up cell turnover to eliminate debris and prevent future clogs. Dr. Schaffran says these ingredients can be irritating for certain people, so if you have sensitive skin, you might want to choose patches like our Best Overall pick, the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Hero Mighty Patch</a>, that just use hydrocolloid to absorb oil rather than pull out blackheads.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Another common ingredient in pore strips is charcoal, which is supposed to further help draw out oil and impurities from the skin. However, Dr. Schaffran says it's not clear how effective charcoal really is at absorbing oil. "There is little to no evidence to substantiate the claims that skincare companies are making about the use of activated charcoal in products." she says. While it is too early to confirm the benefits of charcoal, it is unlikely to be truly harmful. You can determine your own level of comfort with this ingredient.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Size & Shape</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While most strips are designed for the bridge of your nose, there are some oversized options that will cover the area in between your eyebrows as well (like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Peace Out Pore Treatment Strips</a>).

"When that collection of oil and dead skin cells gets exposed to air, it oxidizes and turns black, leading to the appearance of blackheads on the surface." Blackheads are very common, but some people or skin types may be more predisposed to them due to oil production or skin care routine.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do I use a pore strip?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Using a pore strip is fairly straightforward — you put it on the desired area, wait the recommended amount of time, and then slowly pull it off and stare in wonder at all the gunk it pulled out. For the best results, board-certified dermatologist, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Sandra Lee</a>, M.D. (aka Dr. Pimple Popper) recommends taking a hot shower first to steam your face and loosen the gunk in your pores.

"What I don't like about pore strips is that it is like tape stripping your face, so though satisfying, you can't do it every week," she says. "What I do like about pore strips is that, like a comedone extractor, they pull up those comedonal plugs rather than squeezing — which can lead to wider pores and broken blood vessels. If you are someone who cannot keep their hands off their blackheads, I would rather you use a pore strip once every two weeks than squeeze, pull, or tug at sensitive areas on your face."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Can pore strips make your pores look bigger?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">"No. Pore strips won't make your pores look bigger, but they often don't work, so sometimes pores are simply getting fulleron their own despite using pore strips," says Dr. Schaffran.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While pore strips can help unclog your pores, they don't prevent them from getting clogged in the first place (more on that below).
