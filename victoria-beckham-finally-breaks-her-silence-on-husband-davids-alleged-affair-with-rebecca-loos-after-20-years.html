Rumours swirled, and Victoria confessed those following months were perhaps the most gruelling of her life.</p><p id=ejQl7bsBq8C data-wc=39>In an intimate conversation during their Netflix documentary, <a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;which premiered in London on Tuesday,</a>Victoria shared: "It was the hardest period for us. Because it felt like the world was against us.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1c71f8f44061-gettyimages-1715809879.jpg><p id=e24qoZc9s8 data-wc=65>"We were against each other... Up until Madrid sometimes it felt like us against everybody else but we were together, we were connected, we had each other. But in Spain, it felt disjointed." The profound pain from that period was evident, with Victoria admitting that she often felt isolated, even from David. "[It was] the most unhappy I have ever been in my entire life."</p><p id=epUKpBl_aQ data-wc=50>Equally reflective, David struggled to find words to depict their crisis in 2003, remembering how they felt like they were "drowning". He confided: "Every time that we woke up we felt there was something else... we both felt at the time that we were not losing each other but drowning."</p><p id=eDXDyDGpkWS data-wc=27>As the world speculated, David recalled the daily agony: "I felt physically sick every day when I opened my eyes, 'How am I going to do this?'"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/cec0f0c70634-gettyimages-121051728.jpg><p id=e_hStqnrAR data-wc=23>The Beckhams' openness in the documentary seemed a testament to their desire for authenticity.

This separation exacerbated David’s sense of loneliness and isolation in Spain. He recounted, "I get sold overnight, the next minute I'm in a city, I don't speak the language. More importantly, I didn't have my family."</p><p id=eyLb8jE87Ly data-wc=30>The couple's resilience, however, shone through. David expressed how vital Victoria was to him, noting that they had to "fight for each other, we needed to fight for our family."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3304cc485db2-gettyimages-1715810397.jpg><p id=epw0N6-cXTQ data-wc=48>As part of their healing process, the family relocated to Madrid, buying a home which Victoria took pride in decorating. Their son, Cruz, was born there, signaling a fresh start. Yet, Victoria admitted moving had its challenges, sharing her reservations and the strain it added to their relationship.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="I went to the Beckham premiere - and here's my honest review of the first episodes" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/4321818771bd-david-beckham-victoria-premiere.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="I went to the Beckham premiere - and here's my honest review of the first episodes" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>I went to the Beckham premiere - and here's my honest review of the first episodes</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=eHevtsEPBBI data-wc=42>The couple found reprieve when they shifted to Los Angeles, where David played for LA Galaxy. Victoria spoke of the city with affection, describing it as "a place where everything was just so much easier... LA was a great place to live."</p><p id=e1mX6EddeLY data-wc=28>However, challenges persisted. Victoria expressed her exasperation when David considered a temporary move to AC Milan, reflecting on the sacrifices she'd made for the sake of their family.</p><p id=ejm941M2GAP data-wc=50>Their journey, with all its highs and lows, culminates in the documentary's finale, depicting the family dancing joyfully in their Oxfordshire home. As they approach their 25th wedding anniversary, Victoria mused: "I feel happy now, I feel really content now," a testament to the couple’s enduring bond amidst life’s storms.</p><h3 class="factBoxTitleClass_f1xis0ve hm-heading">David and Victoria's relationship timeline</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/53e7bc0f1be2-gettyimages-498473420.jpg><p id=ezuKAKOXnq><strong>1997&nbsp;</strong>– The couple meet in the Manchester United players' lounge – and it is reportedly love at first sight.</p><p id=ezgtxlLGah4><strong>1998&nbsp;</strong> – David pops the question on 25 January with a three-carat, marquise-cut sparkler from Boodle and Dunthorpe.</p><p id=eq9ywqrYAVR><strong>1999</strong> – &nbsp;The duo tie the knot in July, four months after the arrival of their first child, Brooklyn.</p><p id=e846hJhDvXn><strong>2002</strong> – Second son Romeo is born in London on 1 September.</p><p id=eed-jLvSTUc><strong>2003&nbsp;</strong>– Allegations of an affair between David and his PA, Rebecca Loos, surface</p><p id=eNCGkj_0XZb><strong>2005</strong> – Third son Cruz is born on 20 February.</p><p id=efakRVbMPiB><strong>2011</strong> – First daughter, Harper Seven, is born on 10 July.</p><p id=eD_wyOmD-RA><strong>2017</strong> – Eighteen years after they married, the couple renew their wedding vows in January.</p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>Christian Horner and Anna Wintour among celebrities in attendance at the Beckham premiere last night&nbsp;</strong></h2><h3><strong>Christian Horner and Bluebell Halliwell</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3db7cdc1576c-christian-horner-bluebell-beckham-premiere.jpg><p id=eS9txzX64dH data-wc=35>F1 president, Christian Horner stepped out with his step-daughter, Bluebell Halliwell, to support the Beckham clan, whilst his wife, and fellow-former Spice Girl, Geri Halliwell was in the US for her appearance on Jimmy Fallon.</p><h3>Anna Wintour</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/98423d7a3fd6-gettyimages-1715545732.jpg><p id=eEIvMTWBcG data-wc=22>Fashion icon Anna Wintour was the epitome of chic as she headed out to support fellow fashion mogul, Victoria Beckham last night.</p><h3>Holly Ramsay</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2e16ac8d4595-holly-ramsay.jpg><p id=eOBLF96RcE data-wc=34>Gordon Ramsay's eldest daughter <a class=hm-link href=#>Holly was pictured at last night'</a>s star-studded screening.
