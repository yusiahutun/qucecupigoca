Will Smith has been one of the biggest movie stars on the planet for more than two decades now — the very definition of an American success story in just about every possible way — and yet, one night in March, at an awards ceremony that should have been the culmination of his incredible career, everything changed. Smith went from the man everyone couldn’t wait to cheer for winning his first Oscar to a man <a href=#>banned from the event</a> for the next decade.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clbzathft00673b6uu0s4tgou@published data-word-count=124>Whether or not all that is fair or unfair will remain a hotly contested debate — it feels like we’ll be yelling at each other about the Slap for decades — but it has unquestionably blurred public perception of just how varied, ambitious and fascinating Smith’s many performances have been. But you shouldn’t deny the scope of Smith’s career. From youthful rap to&nbsp;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&nbsp;to&nbsp;Independence Day&nbsp;to global domination, Smith was on you so fast you barely had time to register that he’d taken over the world. And, at least until the Slap, he remained likable and relatable, even when his star has taken a dip or two. He even managed to still be charming in&nbsp;Suicide Squad, which one would have thought impossible.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clbzatn3500763b6uqmvuhhzs@published data-word-count=50>And don’t think he doesn’t have depth, either, playing “serious” roles in both dramas (Ali)&nbsp;and four-quadrant blockbusters (I Am Legend).&nbsp;Even with his missteps,&nbsp;<a href=#>Smith</a>&nbsp;remains the sort of movie star you just don’t see anymore.&nbsp;With the release of&nbsp;Emancipation, <a href=#>his first post-Slap movie</a>, we went back and ranked all of his movie performances.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjmgxc9iz001f3h61ph350ky2@published>33. <a data-vars-anchor-text="After Earth" href=#>After Earth</a> (2013)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjmgxcj02001q3h61iv9omh1c@published data-word-count=102>The debacle that prompted Smith to take an 18-month hiatus from acting, After Earth really is as bad as you remember: an overly ponderous, drag-ass sci-fi action-drama in which Will’s son Jaden wholly lacks the charisma that made his dad a mega-star. What undoubtedly made its failure harder on Smith was that he had dreamed up the original story and thrust his son into the central role, figuring it would propel him up the Hollywood food chain. Maybe that’s why Smith looks so glum throughout the film: He seems to be realizing in real time what a bad idea After Earth was.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjmgxdfvw002i3h618kbo7vzj@published>32. <a data-vars-anchor-text="Collateral Beauty" href=#>Collateral Beauty</a> (2016)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjmgxd8bg002a3h614kxz8k79@published data-word-count=131>Yeah, it’s the complete misguided mess that you’ve heard it is, but all told, it’s more embarrassing for Edward Norton, Michael Pena, and Kate Winslet — who play the awful human beings meant to be the “good guys” of this bewildering “heartwarmer”&nbsp;— than it is for Smith, who is mostly put-upon and thus escapes the true awfulness. The real problem with Smith here is one that’s common to many of his “serious” performances: He turns down the star wattage that we love about Will Smith and turns mopey and morose. There are already enough mopey and morose actors: There’s no need for you to be one, Will. Though to be fair: It’s possible he realized the dog of a movie he was in and just couldn’t work up any smiles anyway.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjmgxdvc6002z3h61cuzpubmp@published>31. <a data-vars-anchor-text="Men in Black II" href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow data-track-type=product-link>Men in Black II</a>&nbsp;(2002)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjmgxe52g003i3h61e4pukydo@published data-word-count=82>Everything that was terrific about the first Men in Black — the witty premise, the hip tone, the oil-and-vinegar rapport between Smith and Tommy Lee Jones — evaporates in this strained, unfunny sequel.

Seriously, check out this crazy cast: Dermot Mulroney, Sean Astin, Lara Flynn Boyle, Christian Slater, David Arquette, Nancy McKeon, Alyssa Milano, Ricki Lake! Smith, in his first film, plays Manny, a legless homeless kid who mostly shows up to be friendly, move a wheelchair quickly, and get beaten up.

There’s nothing offensive in it, nothing Smith will cringe when he watches in 20 years, but nothing particularly interesting either. For all of Michael Bay’s Michael Bay-ness, he at least keeps his movies moving and kinetic. Directors Adil and Bilall, while dutiful and energetic, can inspire no such energy from either of their leading men. It’s funny that people talked about this movie happening for 20 years and then immediately forgot about it when it happened.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjmgxrpjn005y3h61ahm677lm@published>21. <a data-vars-anchor-text="Bad Boys II" href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow data-track-type=product-link>Bad Boys II</a> (2003)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjmgxrue0006h3h61z6ys3u7e@published data-word-count=90>Smith didn’t have to do this sequel — he was already the biggest movie star on the planet at this point — and he probably should have stayed away. This is Michael Bay trying maybe a little too much comedy, to the point that the opening sequence takes place at a Klan rally in which Martin Lawrence gets shot in the butt. It goes downhill from there, but Smith somehow keeps it afloat, largely because he’s Will Smith and has an internal governor that won’t let him sink too low.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjmgxsefi007k3h61cvezpccj@published>20. <a data-vars-anchor-text="Jersey Girl" href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow data-track-type=product-link>Jersey Girl</a> (2004)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjmgxsjvp00843h61l4lgbaou@published data-word-count=158>Yes, Will Smith was in a Kevin Smith movie. Only briefly, though. This brief, and ill-fated, attempt by Kevin Smith to become a Serious Hollywood Filmmaker fell on its face — to be fair, it would have difficult for anything to survive Bennifer — but it’s worth pointing out that Smith has a wonderful little cameo here. Playing himself, he comes across Ben Affleck’s character in a hospital waiting room and provides the film its only genuine moment, in which he and Affleck share a moment of understanding and commiseration that feels earned. It’s also funny how Smith plays himself. Unlike most movie stars, who feel the need to send up their persona, Smith is just how he sees himself, and maybe how he actually is: A laid-back guy who’s living the best life and can’t believe how lucky he is. Few movie stars have felt so comfortable in their own skin. You see that surprisingly well here.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjvzkmuw1001n3h65v440s3mk@published>19. <a data-vars-anchor-text=Aladdin href=#>Aladdin</a> (2019)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjvzkn3fl002i3h65se4l1ga2@published data-word-count=168>After the initial Aladdin trailer, which revealed Will Smith as the <a href=#>Big Blue Dude</a>, received less-than-stellar responses from the internet, it was reasonable to go into this live-action remake with major worries. Lowered expectations are probably for the best: The new movie isn’t terrible, although it’s certainly a far cry from the original. Ditto Smith as the jovial genie. Weirdly, for all the hits he’s been a part of over the decades, he’s rarely done what you’d call a straight-up family film, outside of maybe Shark Tale, so it’s interesting to see him tap into his big-kid gusto in such a pronounced way. Still, anyone attempting to outdo Robin Williams is asking for trouble, so it’s just as well that Smith doesn’t try, mostly playing the character as the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air all grown up. Too much of this Aladdin seems designed chiefly to make money, and likewise Smith’s performance is profoundly efficient — it’s a somewhat impressive technical and creative feat that no one really needed.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjmgxtanv00993h612e9g6uvo@published>18. <a data-vars-anchor-text=Focus href=#>Focus</a> (2015)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjmgxtgig009u3h61sxxtir0l@published data-word-count=99>Smith is extremely fun as a con man — the first con man he’d played since Six Degrees of Separation 20 years earlier, a movie that strikes a very different pitch — in a movie that never quite figures out whether it’s a heist comedy, a dark thriller, or something. He has obvious rapport with Margot Robbie, which would carry over to a worse movie in Suicide Squad, and, as usual, he effortlessly gets the audience on his side. The story has too many twists and turns to be taken seriously, but it’s worth it just to hang out.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjmgxva5r00b03h61cozlfazh@published>17. <a data-vars-anchor-text=Concussion href=#>Concussion</a> (2015)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjmgxvgdp00bm3h61r3dgpdqo@published data-word-count=69>Smith’s best straight-drama performance since 2006’s The Pursuit of Happyness finds him playing Bennet Omalu, a soft-spoken Nigerian doctor living in Pittsburgh who helped uncover the traumatic brain injuries devastating NFL players.

Fortunately, Smith is still dedicated enough to sell the dynamic between his two selves, and there are even some moving moments in which you see him struggling to reckon with his younger self, both onscreen and off. But if you’re going to re-create a young Will Smith … don’t you have to make him more fun than this?</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjmgxzehh00jl3h61o242vu61@published>12. <a data-vars-anchor-text="Men in Black 3" href=#>Men in Black 3</a> (2012)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjmgxzmo900kc3h61fiojrhom@published data-word-count=89>This was the first movie Smith made after 2008’s Hancock and Seven Pounds, and the four years away from multiplexes only reminded us how much we loved the guy. Men in Black 3 washes away the bad memories of the 2002 sequel, pairing Smith mostly with Josh Brolin, who’s playing Tommy Lee Jones’s Agent K in the past. The time-jumping narrative and Brolin’s spot-on Jones impression are the movie’s highlights, which allows Smith to ease back into movie-star mode, supplying Agent J with endless cool and still-stellar comic timing.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjmgy0mdh00lv3h61z6gq1gga@published>11. <a data-vars-anchor-text="I, Robot" href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow data-track-type=product-link>I, Robot</a> (2004)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjmgy0rtr00mn3h61tnlkdyqi@published data-word-count=77>A fairly basic thriller that hasn’t aged particularly well — unlike the Isaac Asimov book it’s based on — and feels compromised, not least of which by some truly bizarre product placement. Smith can play this sort of Wry Cop in his sleep, but he’s a steadying force among all the chaos around him. He’s also a surprisingly urgent action star: He’s physical, sure, but also vulnerable and insistent. He makes it look easier than it is.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjmgy1rv500pq3h61crs87qg2@published>10. <a data-vars-anchor-text="Enemy of the State" href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow data-track-type=product-link>Enemy of the State</a> (1998)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjmgy1x7w00qj3h61k0bz0h3f@published data-word-count=91>This Tony Scott action-thriller came out during Smith’s bulletproof period where he could do no wrong. (Spoiler alert: The following year’s Wild Wild West would end that streak.) He’s not the cool cat or the cocky showboat this time, though: He plays a mild-mannered lawyer mixed up in a government conspiracy, with only Gene Hackman’s mysterious operative able to save him. Enemy of the State was Smith’s dry run for the dramatic roles he would soon be pursuing, and he’s commanding and sympathetic as a regular guy fighting for his life.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjmgy3qcg00s63h61xn2wpnm3@published>9. <a data-vars-anchor-text=Hancock href=#>Hancock</a> (2008)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjmgy453h00t03h61q1ish71b@published data-word-count=72>Smith’s nerviest blockbuster finds him playing a superhero who’s also an asshole, and the actor seems tickled at the prospect of tweaking his own squeaky-clean image. Hancock doesn’t always balance its desire to be a dark satire of comic-book movies with its need to deliver supersized, put-asses-in-the-seats spectacle. But Smith finds the nuance and pain in an all-powerful character who can save the world but can’t get out of his own way.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clbzb7g9u00cx3b6ufw2pbol2@published>8. <a data-vars-anchor-text=Emancipation href=#>Emancipation</a> (2022)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clbzb7tjl00dx3b6unaozfgon@published data-word-count=104><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Smith’s first post-Slap movie was almost not released, and it does seem a little buried on Apple TV. While director Antoine Fuqua’s approach to the heady material is a little more action-movie glib than you might like (does a movie about an escaping slave really need a scene where he fights an alligator?), Smith makes up for it with an oft-wordless performance in which his pure physicality and presence carries the entire movie. This is his Revenant, but Smith is less showy than DiCaprio; he simply invests this man with gravity, and a spine of cement, that is all the weight the film needs.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjmgy4uiw00uo3h61oz9oub8x@published>7. <a data-vars-anchor-text="The Pursuit of Happyness" href=#>The Pursuit of Happyness</a> (2006)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjmgy55vb00vj3h61cwsiaxdn@published data-word-count=90>One of the hardest things for A-list stars to do is portray “ordinary” people. (Stay too long in the limelight and you lose the common touch.) But Smith earned his second Best Actor nomination effortlessly playing Chris Gardner, who in the early 1980s fell into homelessness while raising his young son (Smith’s own son Jaden). There’s nothing showy in Smith’s performance, which is crucial for a character who’s been beaten down by life but still clings to a defiant optimism. Smith’s obvious affection for his boy radiates through the screen.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjmgy668m00xa3h61rsd3pc7q@published>6. <a data-vars-anchor-text="Six Degrees of Separation" href=#>Six Degrees of Separation</a> (1995)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjmgy6mjy00y63h6192clc4vs@published data-word-count=128>This adaptation of John Guare’s Pulitzer Prize–winning play had all the Appeal to the Smart Upper East Side Crowd cachet a young actor looking to make a splash would want, but what’s stunning is how much fire and passion Smith brings to the performance, at times wiping seasoned vets Donald Sutherland and Stockard Channing right off the screen. Smith is a little mannered at first as a grifter who cons a cultured NYC couple into believing he’s Sidney Poitier’s son, but once his ruse is discovered, he, and the film, turn into something much more raw and searing. Even if you found Smith charming before this, his performance snapped you to attention: Wait, he can do this? In some ways, he hasn’t quite challenged himself as much since.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjmgy77c500zy3h61ndmy2q0u@published>5. <a data-vars-anchor-text="Independence Day" href=#>Independence Day</a> (1996)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjmgy7l8k010v3h61hz7nmwcq@published data-word-count=96><a href=#>This sequel</a> didn’t bring back Smith, and it left a huge crater at its center: Would we have ever made this such a big hit, would we have ever cared so much, if it hadn’t have been for Smith? The movie is fairly standard disaster-flick porn — albeit done in Roland Emmerich’s harmlessly dumb style — but Smith springs it to life every time he shows up. No wonder he became such a July 4 star: This is America how we want to see ourselves, a little John Wayne, a little Muhammad Ali. Welcome to Earth!</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjmgy7xbp011s3h61ryeqw1xr@published>4. <a data-vars-anchor-text="I Am Legend" href=#>I Am Legend</a> (2007)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjmgy9axb013n3h61es74ulsj@published data-word-count=108>The movie never quite figures out its ending — and <a href=#>the initial ending</a>, from the book but rejected by test audiences, might have been a better place to land — but Smith is incredibly moving as a man who has lost everyone he loved and knew but still, in spite of himself, keeps trudging forward. It’s a tricky performance, and its strength is in Smith’s unwillingness to ever go for the easy out: You can tell he’s invested in what a man like this would go through, and he appears legitimately damaged from it. Not everything in this movie works, but it might be Smith’s most underappreciated performance.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjmgya7io015j3h61fpb1a5m1@published>3. <a data-vars-anchor-text=Ali href=#>Ali</a> (2001)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjmgyatc8016i3h61fw5t3rg6@published data-word-count=88>Muhammad Ali’s death may have brought newfound appreciation to this deeply moving, under-loved biopic, but the greatness of Smith’s performance was never in dispute. Ali merges the two sides of this dynamic actor — the electric entertainer and the soulful dramatist — into one perfect whole, presenting the iconic boxer as the ultimate showman who was also sensitive to (and swept up in) the political and racial turmoil swirling around him. Earning his first Oscar nomination, Smith uses his charisma like a weapon, tapping into Ali’s sting-like-a-bee magnetism.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjmgyc2j5018g3h61pafeq2db@published>2.

But be honest: This is the movie — and character — you first think of when someone mentions Will Smith. Men in Black is a miracle of a blockbuster — a snazzy, funny, eye-popping sci-fi action movie — and Smith treats the whole enterprise like one big lark. No movie star makes blasé irreverence feel hipper, just as no other movie star makes event movies feel like the coolest thing in the world. You know what? <a href=#>He did make this look good.</a></p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckwdp1a0900113e6jcuqyeaw8@published>1. <a data-vars-anchor-text="King Richard" href=#>King Richard</a> (2021)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckwdqkhtc00203e6jtu3rhkwi@published data-word-count=199>Richard Williams is, in every possible way, unreasonable. He’s stubborn, incorrigible, obnoxious, and so certain of his own virtue and judgment that everyone who deals with him ends up wanting to pull their hair out. (Someone’s going to make a great supercut of this film featuring only people’s exasperated reactions to him.) The thing is, though, somehow he turns out to be right about everything. This authorized but hardly hagiographic biopic of Williams, who famously told the world that his two little daughters would grow up to be the best tennis players in the world, and then&nbsp;they were, is a stirring, uplifting sports movie, sure — it will definitely make your kids want to go outside and play some tennis — but it’s also an incredible showcase for Smith, who plays Williams as an unmovable object: The parent as impenetrable fortress, an advocate for his kids often in the face of any good sense. Smith’s Williams is a force of nature — charming, narcissistic, prideful, wounded, fiercely protective, and gloriously impossible. And again, he turns out to be right about everything. Smith clearly feels a kinship with this man, and it results in the best performance of his career.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjmgyf6tz01f83h61gmfj3875@published data-word-count=28>Grierson & Leitch write about the movies regularly for the New Republic and host a <a href=#>podcast on film</a>.
