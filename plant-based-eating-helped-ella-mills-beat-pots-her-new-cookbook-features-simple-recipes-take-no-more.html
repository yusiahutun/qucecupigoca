She aims to have the recipes take less than 30 minutes to make, use no more than five simple steps, and need 10 ingredients or less.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I just found that was essentially the sweet spot where action and reality merged closer together,” she says.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">‘Fitter than ever’: she feels benefits of a whole food, plant-based diet</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Mills took a hard look at some of her favourite dishes and tried to create a better balance between flavour, practicality, nutrition and speed.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“What I found was that oftentimes there was an extra step or an extra pan in there, or like two or three extra ingredients. And it probably made it 5 per cent nicer or 10 per cent nicer,” she says. “But I’d end up not making the recipes any more because it was just that little bit more effort.”</p>Healthy Made Simple celebrates whole foods and uses proteins from things like nuts, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">tofu</span></a>, lentils, beans and chickpeas. The flavours are global, with ingredients including harissa, udon, satay, miso, pesto, tagine and curry.“As you start to look around the world, there are so many places where not necessarily the whole society is vegetarian, but <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">vegetables are the hero</span></a> and they’re treated with a lot of TLC,” she says.<figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">We so often see health and looking after ourselves as a trend, as a fad, as a six-week plan. Ultimately, that’s not healthElla Mills</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Take her one-pan peanut and cauliflower stew, which combines peanut butter, ginger, coconut milk, garlic, rice and curry powder with simmering cauliflower florets. It’s got heat and crunch and tastes indulgent.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lauren Whelan, the publisher for Yellow Kite, the lifestyle and cooking imprint of Hodder & Stoughton, says Mills’ creativity shows the versatility and simplicity of plants. Her sweet potato brownies revolutionised the way that the vegetable is used in the UK, Whelan says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">If Mills is an evangelist for vegetarianism, she says she’s proof of its benefits. At 21, she was diagnosed with postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS), a condition in which the heart rate increases quickly after getting up from sitting or lying down. This affected her nervous system, and she was put on a variety of medications.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Better heart health – for you and your family</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She chose to overhaul her diet and started documenting her experience in a blog. Able to wean herself off medicines, Mills has since built up her Deliciously Ella business into seven cookbooks and a food brand.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Mills isn’t preachy and knows her readers may not be ready to go full-on vegetarian. For her, it’s about small steps that can make meaningful changes, like making one or two plant-based dishes a week or highlighting a vegetable one night with the meat as the side dish.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This is not all or nothing. This is not ‘everyone should go plant-based tomorrow’ or ‘everyone should only cook from this book,’” she says. “But it’s like on a Sunday night when you’re at home, could you do one of these recipes and then you’d have some leftovers for lunch?”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">10 surprising ways a whole food, plant-based diet will benefit your health</span></p></a></h3>One of her new dishes – spicy sun-dried tomato and eggplant ragu – is perfect for sceptics. It adds some heat from harissa and chilli to a pasta with eggplant and parsley, finished with <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">walnuts</span></a>.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It has this kind of chunky, bolognese, ragu-esque texture. That’s the kind of thing that I would make a lot for friends or family who are not sure they’re going to love plant-based stuff, but when you’re tossing that through some nice spaghetti you can always serve it with Parmesan on the side,” she says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Mills knows the world of health and wellness often chases trends, but she believes in the ultimate power of a well-dressed carrot.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We so often see health and looking after ourselves as a trend, as a fad, as a six-week plan. Ultimately, that’s not health. Health is looking after yourself for decades,” she says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And to do that, “It can’t be deprivation. It has to be something you want to do on a regular basis.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOwu8Nmm6uhnqB8or7TopqlnV9of3Z%2FkHFuaKiclru1ecGaqp6cXZqutbXNoGShnZylsqV5xKWjmmWdnrmtv4ybnJqsXaW8tb%2BMoZyrZZ6axG6vzqiim6efoHqnscCtrKudo2LAqrnPpZxmqpWYtrGx0marmqOVYruwecyoqZ4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./taraji-p-henson-sequin-dress-women-of-the-year.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Taraji P.
