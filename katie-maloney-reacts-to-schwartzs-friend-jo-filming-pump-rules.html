Yikes,” the Something About Her cofounder responded.</p><p>Eagle-eyed followers also noticed that Katie and <a href=#><strong>Lala Kent</strong></a> filmed new scenes for season 11 with friend <a href=#><strong>Kristina Kelly</strong></a>.</p><p>Lala, 32, uploaded an <a href=#>Instagram</a>&nbsp;photo of the trio on Tuesday, writing, “Katie and I are so in sync, we position our heads the same way in pictures 👯‍♀️ Welcome back, Kristina! You’ll be running back to your son and locking your doors in no time 😈 The black wire is my mic.”</p><p>This isn’t the first time<a href=#> the cast has documented filming of season 11</a> in the aftermath of Sandoval’s affair with <a href=#><strong>Raquel Leviss</strong></a> — which led to his split from <a href=#><strong>Ariana Madix</strong></a>. Before the cheating scandal came to light in March, however, <a href=#>Schwartz’s personal life was at the center of season 10.</a></p><p>Schwartz and Katie <a href=#>announced their decision to part ways</a> in March 2022 following more than a decade together. He later raised eyebrows when Us Weekly confirmed in August 2022 that Schwartz hooked up with Raquel, 28, at <a href=#><strong>Scheana Shay</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Brock Davies</strong></a>‘ wedding.</p><p>Other fans, meanwhile, were questioning <a href=#>Schwartz’s connection with Jo after footage surfaced</a> of the duo from a December 2022 concert.</p><p>“Jo is a badass hairstylist. I think she’s a beautiful soul,” Schwartz exclusively told Us in February. “We’re not living together and we’re not dating either, but she’s just someone who I appreciate on a deep level and she’s a really cool human being, and we’re just hanging out.”</p><p>One month later, news broke that Sandoval <a href=#>was having an affair with Raquel before his split</a> from Ariana, 38. Katie, for her part, addressed claims that Schwartz’s brief connection with Raquel<a href=#> was a ruse to cover up his private romance with Jo.</a></p><p>“Jo is spooky. I mean none of us could stand to be around her. Her energy is on par with a crack head,” she wrote in an Instagram comment at the time. “But when Tom and I announced our divorce almost a year ago the last thing she text me was ‘Bieber loves you / I love you, and I’m so supporting of your inner thoughts and visions / live in the moment, you’re a gem and I’ve always respected you. I love you. Xo Jo.’ She is a psycho and I will also light her on fire with Rachel [Leviss’ birth name].”</p><p>Katie also <a href=#>had plenty to share about Jo on the show</a>, saying in an April episode, “Jo was literally <a href=#><strong>Kristen Doute</strong></a>‘s crazy friend. If you’re Kristen Doute’s crazy friend, that says a lot about you. The last text Jo sent me after Tom and I announced our divorce was her saying she will always love and respect me. And the fact that she moved in with Schwartz two seconds later, she’s that kind of bitch.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In response, Schwartz<a href=#> came to Jo’s defense after confirming their casual</a> relationship. “No she wasn’t [my girlfriend]. Especially not at that point. It did evolve into a situationship or a friends with benefits things with clearly defined boundaries,” he detailed during the May reunion special. “We were both coming out of long-term relationships and for a minute there we were each other’s happy places.”</p><p>Schwartz warned Katie that <a href=#>she would be hit with a “cease and desist”</a> if she continued throwing shade at Jo, adding, “Katie don’t do that, don’t disparage her. You’re going to get a cease and desist if you keep attacking her in the comments, too.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKKarJmaeq6ty6ilnrFdp7Kir9OsZK2nXaiwqcPAq6uzq12bv6qxzZ1ko6ddm7atucinnmaopaK9br7UpZysZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./518975-kenya-power-apologises-customers-nationwide-blackout-working-restore-electricity.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kenya Power Apologises to Customers Over Nationwide Blackout: &amp;quot;We're Working to Restore Electricity&amp;quot;</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dwts-host-julianne-hough-announces-huge-career-news-away-from-the-show.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>DWTS host Julianne Hough announces huge career news away from the show</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amal-clooney-mob-wife-trend-cream-fur-coat.html>Amal Clooney Elevates the Mob Wife Trend in a Cream Fur Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./demolition-underway-at-washington-elementary-davenport.html>Demolition underway at Washington Elementary, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iowa-man-killed-in-head-on-crash.html>Iowa man killed in head-on crash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./style-edit-richard-milles-technically-ambitious-new-rm-30-01-automatic-luxury-watch-was-inspired.html>Style Edit: Richard Milles technically ambitious new RM 30-01 Automatic luxury watch was inspired</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./463481-what-happened-frankie-lons-life-story-death.html>What happened to Frankie Lons?
