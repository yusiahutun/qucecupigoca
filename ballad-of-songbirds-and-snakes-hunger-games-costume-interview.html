A huge volume of materials and efforts go into the back end, and only a few things trickle out onto the screen for audiences to see. When we caught up with Trish Summerville, the costume director and creative force behind the fashion of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a43741482/the-ballad-of-songbirds-and-snakes-release-date-cast-news-spoilers/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes</a>, she gave us a real insider sneak peek into the logistics, the advance planning, and how much stuff—and we mean trucks and trucks and trucks of physical stuff—it takes to costume this highly anticipated prequel.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For instance: If a main character wears a really great dress for 10 pivotal minutes of the film, that dress might have existed as 10 multiples of the same dress, to ensure there were plenty of backups in case of onscreen accidents, for stunt doubles, and so forth. And when you costume 500 background extras, the shoes and socks required can easily soar into the thousands.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Not that any of this is new to Summerville. Ten years ago she costumed The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, so she was already familiar with the sartorial universe of Panem. But this time around, we see a deeper, more intimate side of the various districts’ inhabitants—and a level of detail and patina that Summerville says wouldn’t have been achievable without the amazing specialized teams within her costume department this time around. “I’m always happy to have a team of people who love what they do and really shine,” she tells Harper’s Bazaar.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Here, we pull back the curtain on how Summerville—and her incredible costume department—resurrected the world of The Hunger Games for what could be its most exciting chapter yet.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>You’re back! You worked on The Hunger Games: Catching Fire a decade ago. What does it feel like to come back to this universe?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It was really nice to come back and work with Francis [Lawrence], who directed Catching Fire, and Jo Willems, the director of photography, but do things completely differently. Even though I enjoyed the outlandish, decadent world of Catching Fire, it was nice to do something in that same story and franchise that had a completely different look.</p><img alt="honor gillies as barb azure, konstantin taffet as clerk carmine and rachel zegler as lucy gray baird in the hunger games the ballad of songbirds and snakes photo credit murray close" title="The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes" width=3000 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/boss-unit-220823-00524-r-6536a595ee8c2.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Murray Close/Lionsgate</span></p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>How did you make Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes look different from the original Hunger Games films?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We leaned into a very 1940s and ’50s postwar feel. The book leans into that. It’s set very recently after a big rebellion and war. … Since we landed on the ’40s and ’50s, I did a lot of research on American fashion, especially from everyday blue-collar workers. For example, for District 12, looking at what coal miners looked like then. But we also looked at what people dressed like in different parts of the United States, because this time around we see more of the districts. We really get to see their life and them enjoying life. So we brought in more flora and fauna with patterns, prints, and color.</p><img alt="fionnula flanagan as grandma'am, tom blyth as coriolanus snow and hunter schafer as tigris snow in the hunger games the ballad of songbirds and snakes photo credit murray close" title="The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes" width=2880 height=1920 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/boss-unit-221104-00275-r-6536a51e1bcc2.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Murray Close/Lionsgate</span></p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Do you have a favorite fashion “moment” audiences should watch out for?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s so hard to choose a favorite, but I am really happy with Lucy Gray’s rainbow dress. That was a really challenging piece. It has a lot of detail in the book about what it is, and I had to go through a lot of iterations of what I wanted it to be. It took me a little bit, but one day it just came to me. And we had a great patina team working on it, too.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Was that a difficult look to get just right?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We had the corset mimic the shape of Jennifer Lawrence’s Katniss’s <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQm8IYFu0U" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="blue mockingjay dress" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">blue mockingjay dress</a>. And a lot of times we’ll start a project before we have a cast, so I kind of started the designs that way. I was ordering all these different colors of tulle in excess. So if there were eight or 10 colors in the skirt, I was ordering all that tulle, shirring it, and playing with the skirt to figure out which colors transitioned well together. Then once we casted, we discovered that Rachel Zegler is quite petite, so we had to scale the whole thing down, reconfigure all the measurements, and figure out how many rows of color to have.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>And I imagine, as an action film, you needed to create multiples of that dress.</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When I design costumes, I look at the script and I walk to the director and then I look at the stunts, and I figure out how many days they’re shooting in that costume. If it’s one “day” in the script we could be shooting that “day” for 10 days. Our shoot started with the Games, so I imagined our actors easily blowing through and destroying two or three costumes. So it’s also about having extra fabric on hand. For the Lucy Gray dress, we premade extra ruffles so that if they ripped off, it would be quick to stitch them back on. And then you have to make stuff for the stunt doubles as well.</p><img alt="ballad still" title="ballad still" width=1920 height=801 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/boss-trailer-2-grab-22-hd-c-6536a4b3bb68c.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Lionsgate</span></p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>I’m always amazed by how much “stuff” it takes to costume a film. We as the audience might see a single dress, but on set, that single look might have existed as 10 multiples of the same dress.</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It really takes a tribe, and that’s something people don’t think about. And sometimes it’s something I have to explain to certain producers. Look at the students in the Academy, for instance. We built all of those ourselves. If you’re dressing 500 background actors in school uniforms, you need two or three times that amount in costumes. At times we were doing 25 to 50 people a day for fittings, and you need an excess, because what if all the people who come in that day wear the size medium? You have to have lots of space, and teams of people that dress people in the morning—because we may need to dress people at 4:00 a.m. so they can go through hair and makeup on time, so they’re ready to shoot at 8:00 a.m. When it’s all fine-tuned, it’s beautiful.</p><img alt="tom blyth as coriolanus snow and costume designer trish summerville in the hunger games the ballad of songbirds and snakes photo credit murray close" title=" The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes" width=3600 height=2400 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/boss-unit-220817-00134-r-653bc743de94c.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Murray Close/Lionsgate</span><p>Tom Blyth as Coriolanus Snow and costume designer Trish Summerville.</p><img alt="director francis lawrence and costume designer trish summerville in the hunger games the ballad of songbirds and snakes photo credit murray close" title="The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes" width=3600 height=2463 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/boss-unit-220803-00108-r-653ff6e73ceef.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Murray Close/Lionsgate</span><p>Director Francis Lawrence and Trish Summerville.</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>You mentioned that your costume department had a patina team? What do they do?</strong><br></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For this film, I wanted a lot of handiwork, aging and dying, so the patina team is a group of people who are brilliant artists who can age, dye, and paint. They dye clothing and yardage of fabrics, and can age things so they don’t look brand new. Everything had to be aged the right way. Then there were some hard tasks, like hand painting and matching eight or 10 multiples of corsets so they all look the same for Lucy Gray. … I’m always happy to have a team of people who love what they do and really let them shine, and I had that here, especially with this patina team.</p><h2 data-node-id=25 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Was there anything your actors tried to pilfer from set?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Oh, of course! I understand it—they’re in these pieces for so long. We shoot for so long, and everybody has their favorite thing. And we had a lot of actors [where] this was their first film, so lots of them wanted a keepsake. I always have to explain, you can’t have this because we may have to do reshoots, and because the studio makes you do an accounting of all your assets. As a teaser, I can share that we’re doing a merch line inspired by Ballad, so I’m hoping they’ll take some pieces home that way.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/harpersbazaar/static/images/logos/lettermark.934d28d.svg?primary=%2523000" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=100 width=100 alt=Lettermark style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Todd Plummer is a Boston based journalist covering culture and lifestyle.
