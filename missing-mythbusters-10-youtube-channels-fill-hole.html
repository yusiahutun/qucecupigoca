That leaves a big hole for those of us who like answers to the "what ifs" of life, and who actually experiment in order to find answers. But don't worry, as YouTube has plenty of channels perfect for fans of Mythbusters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mythbusters sparked a generation of YouTube stars who followed in their footsteps, conducting all kinds of experiments for the fun of it. There's always science involved, of course. After all, where's the fun in doing cool and weird things if you aren't analyzing them for science?</p><p>From tackling misconceptions to the "let's see what happens when..." kind of videos, these are the YouTube channels that even Adam and Jamie would be proud to be a part of.</p><h2 id=the-slow-mo-guys>1. <a href=#>The Slow Mo Guys</a></h2><p>Meet Gavin Free and Daniel Gruchy, also known as The Slow Mo Guys. Yes, the name tells you everything you need to know about this pair. Armed with a high-speed camera, they shoot videos of cool things and then play them back in slow motion. It's fascinating!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gavin is usually behind the camera, which leaves Dan to do the dirty work. That includes putting his tongue in a mouse trap, exploding a car, and other equally incredible stunts. You'll see the real-time footage first, before the guys play it back in slow motion. It's a visual extravaganza.</p><p>If you <a href=#>learn about slow motion and how to shoot it</a>, you'll truly appreciate just how hard these guys work to deliver the videos they do.</p><h2 id=smarter-every-day>2. <a href=#>Smarter Every Day</a></h2><p>Engineer Destin Sandlin put his interest in science to good use by creating one of the most entertaining YouTube channels around. Smarter Every Day (SED) explores science in the most fun ways possible.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like The Slow Mo Guys, Destin also indulges in slow motion footage. But that's not all he does. He will do crazy stunts like <a href=#>turning gravity into light</a> or shoot an AK-47 rifle underwater. And don't worry, he explains the logic behind all of it.</p><p>Just how big is SED? Big enough to enable Destin to be one of four <a href=#>YouTube personalities who got to interview President Obama</a> in 2016.</p><h2 id=colin-furze>3. <a href=#>Colin Furze</a></h2><p>There is nothing Colin Furze won't do to make a great video, no matter how scared he is. He's a DIY hacker who loves geek culture.</p><p>Take, for example, what happened when he saw <a href=#>Mad Max: Fury Road</a>. While you and I were marveling at the "Doof Warrior", Furze was figuring out how he could get his hands on a flamethrower guitar. So he decided to build one himself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Furze's videos are made better by his personality. He seems to have endless enthusiasm and never runs out of battery. He's a natural in front of the camera, if ever there was one.</p><h2 id=physics-girl>4. <a href=#>Physics Girl</a></h2><p>Dianna Cowern started her channel while in college, but it grew so big that she's still making videos today. Cowern is often credited with making STEM disciplines more entertaining and approachable for girls. Which means her channel could make the list of <a href=#>sites all women should know about</a>.</p><p>The Physics Girl channel explains physics, of course, but also conducts experiments to demonstrate science. For example, the video above shows how a simple plate from the kitchen can create a vortex in your swimming pool!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cowern also makes videos with PBS now, so she updates her YouTube channel updates less frequently. However, each video new video is worth waiting for!</p><h2 id=brusspup>5. <a href=#>Brusspup</a></h2><p>Arthur C. Clarke once said that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. It's not necessarily about being advanced though. Magic stems from our brain's inability to process something. That's what Brusspup specializes in.</p><p>The channel is filled with mesmerizing optical illusions and magic tricks. But the wonderful part is that it also explains the science behind the trick. You probably won't understand how easily the mind can be tricked until you watch these videos.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Don't dismiss the silly-sounding name. Brusspup's videos will have you spellbound and you'll never trust your brain again. It's one of those <a href=#>mind-blowing websites that make you go wow</a>.</p><h2 id=grant-thompson-the-king-of-random>6. <a href=#>Grant Thompson: The King of Random</a></h2><p>Thompson has given himself the perfect self-titled moniker of "The King of Random". Nothing is off limits for his experiments.</p><p>Mythbusters fans will love his approach to topics. If a thought enters his head or he reads something interesting, he's going to explore it in depth. And he'll make sure he records it for your enjoyment. It can be something as strange as starting a fire with a sandwich bag, but the end results are always wonderful to watch.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You can also <a href=#>watch 360-degree videos</a> on Thompson's channel, which adds a new depth to this type of experimental footage.</p><h2 id=simone-s-robots>7. <a href=#>Simone's Robots</a></h2><p>Robots are the future, and no one knows this better than Simone Giertz. This robotics enthusiast isn't an engineer, but she will make any sort of automaton that comes into her mind.</p><p>Simone's self-deprecating humor makes her videos even more entertaining. She often says that she makes "shitty robots," but she is being unkind to herself there. Yes, the ideas are wacky, but that's part of their charm.</p><p>Simone is the embodiment of the nerdy philosophy of doing something just because you can. Maybe watching her videos will inspire you to <a href=#>build your own inexpensive robots</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-backyard-scientist>8. <a href=#>The Backyard Scientist</a></h2><p>What would happen if you poured liquid nitrogen into a swimming pool? Can you grow copper crystals with electricity? Is there a way to make Super Mario Bros fireballs in real life?</p><p>The Backyard Scientist is a mad scientist in the best way possible. You know how certain stunts on Mythbusters had you fearing for the lives of Adam and Jamie? You'll get that all the time with this guy. And that's only half the fun, since you also get answers to questions you never asked.</p><p>The Backyard Scientist uploads one new video every week, so make sure you check back often to discover his latest experiments.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=crazyrussianhacker>9. <a href=#>CrazyRussianHacker</a></h2><p>CrazyRussianHacker is, for the lack of a better term, crazy. He will leave no stone unturned in trying to find the answer to the most ridiculous questions. And he'll have a blast while doing it!</p><p>He is more focussed on life hacks, which makes his channel actually useful in everyday settings. So he will test life hacks that he reads online, or make videos of things he discovered himself. Not everything is a winner, but part of the joy is in watching his process.</p><p>This channel is updated quite frequently, so you should take note of these <a href=#>tips to organize and remember life hacks you saw</a>.</p><h2 id=adam-savage-s-tested>10. <a href=#>Adam Savage's Tested</a></h2><p>Let's finish up the list with the grandaddy of experimental geekery on videos. Adam Savage (yes, he of Mythbusters fame) has his own YouTube channel for doing anything and everything that someone wouldn't pay him to do. And it's as enjoyable as you'd imagine it to be.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not all Tested videos star Savage, but he's in most of them. And regardless, the channel has the spirit of his approach to experiments and DIY that made us all fall in love with Mythbusters in the first place.</p><p>In fact, you can <a href=#>learn the basics of DIY from Tested</a>, apart from generally having a good time watching one of your heroes back in action.</p><h2 id=how-do-you-get-your-geeky-experimental-fix>How Do You Get Your Geeky Experimental Fix?</h2><p>Mythbusters might be gone, but geeky experiments are going nowhere. These YouTube channels prove that Adam and Jamie's "let's make cool experiments" philosophy is alive and kicking. And there are probably several others who believe in this too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Apart from the Mythbusters-inspired channels listed above, which YouTubers do you watch to get your fix of scientific awesomeness?
