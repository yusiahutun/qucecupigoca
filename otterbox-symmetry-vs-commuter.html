You spent a huge chunk of your pay on this device. Naturally, you want to protect your investment. Of course, you’re not just going for any case. You want the best. That’s why you look at one of the most established case makers—Otterbox.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>But, when you search for them, you get a ton of options. Which should you choose? To help you decide, take a look at this Otterbox series comparison. See the difference between OtterBox Symmetry and Commuter cases for yourself.</p><h2 id=protection>Protection</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/phone-with-case-in-winter-e1626366472570.jpg><p>If you’re looking at which of the two protects your phone better, the Commuter case takes the win. This <a href=#>combo case</a> offers two layers of protection—a hard outer case and a soft inner layer.</p><p>The layers work together by both absorbing impacts and deflecting sharp objects. This combination provides excellent protection for your smartphone. Furthermore, the Commuter case has a port cover, ensuring that your phone’s charging port won’t get any debris in it.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Beyond physical protection, some Commuter models have an external case that's impregnated with silver-based additives. This helps stop microbial growth. Although it doesn’t protect your screen, it still prevents common bacteria from sticking to your case and being picked up by your phone.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/commuter-symmetry-cases-iphone-12.jpg><p>The Symmetry case, on the other hand, is a single-piece case. This makes it easy to install and remove, as compared to the Commuter line. It’s also a lot slimmer. Despite that, it still offers comparative protection.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>If you’re going to look at their specifications, both of these cases are DROP+ rated. According to OtterBox, this rating can withstand three times as many drops as the MIL-STD-801G 516.6 military standard. They also both have raised beveled edges. This ensures that the screen and the camera lenses won’t be affected if you drop your phone.</p><p>Both cases add thickness to your phone. But even so, the phone remains slim and pocketable. They let you grip your phone better, reducing your risk of dropping it due to slippery hands. It’s just not recommended to use the Commuter case with extra tight pockets, as they’re slightly thicker than the Symmetry line.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=style-and-variety>Style and Variety</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Samsung-Galaxy-S21-Cases.jpg><p>For some people, smartphones aren’t just tools. They can also be fashion statements and conversation pieces. However, others prefer their phones to be low-profile and anonymous. The Commuter case is perfect if you value protection over anything else.</p><p>The Commuter case currently has four options for the latest smartphones—Black, Rock Skip Way (Blue), Riveting Way (Teal), and Maven Way (Pink)—if you want a different color but need better protection.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>The Symmetry cases, on the other hand, have three lines. They have the Symmetry case, Clear case, and Graphics. The Symmetry case comes with four color options: Reset Purple, Resilience Grey, Black, and Renaissance Pink.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Otterbox-Cases-for-the-Samsung-Galaxy-S22.jpg><p>If your phone has a unique color, you could go for the Clear case. And for the adventurous souls out there, OtterBox offers the Symmetry Graphics case. You can pick the following designs: Stardust Glitter, Wallflower, Enigma (Black/Gold), Impressive Floral, Wild Fauna, Marigold, Ombre Spray, Strawbaby, Plant Parent, and Hello Sunshine.</p><p>Lastly, if you own a MagSafe Charger and want to use it without removing the case, you should opt for the Symmetry Series+ Clear Case with MagSafe. It’s specifically designed for use with Apple’s MagSafe charger and comes in two options: Clear or Stardust Glitter.</p><p>You should know, though, that Otterbox hadn't released an iPhone 13 version of the MagSafe cases at the time of writing. But when it does become available, you should consider getting that one if you're a MagSafe user.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>The Symmetry line gives you a total of 15 designs to choose from. Its slimmer, less bulky form also gives your phone a sleeker look.</p><h2 id=compatibility>Compatibility</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/different-iphone-models-e1626368996186.jpg><p>There are simply too many phones out there for OtterBox to make a case for each one. So, if you’re using a less popular model, there might not be an available case for you. Furthermore, some cases might not fully support a phone’s features.</p><p>So, before you choose a protective case, ensure that it works with the accessories you use on your phone.</p><h3 id=available-models>Available Models</h3><p>The Commuter Series can protect the latest phones from Apple, Samsung, Nokia, Motorola, LG, OnePlus, Google, T-Mobile, and TCL. On the other hand, the Symmetry Series is available for Apple, Samsung, Motorola, LG, OnePlus, Google, and Huawei.</p><h3 id=wireless-charging>Wireless Charging</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/wireless-charging-iphone-e1626369195210.jpg><p>Both cases are designed to be compatible with <a href=#>wireless charging</a>. However, they work best with wireless chargers from OtterBox. You might run into issues with third-party chargers, especially with the Commuter case. Due to its dual-layer design, your wireless charger should have greater power or range to work.</p><p>The Symmetry case occasionally runs into similar problems. But, its thinner design than the Commuter means this is a less prevalent problem. If wireless charging is vital for you, consider getting a charger from OtterBox, as it’s specifically designed to work with their cases.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h3 id=magsafe>MagSafe</h3><p>If you have a MagSafe Charger and want to use it with your iPhone 12, you have no choice but to use the Symmetry Series+ Clear Case with MagSafe. It’s the only compatible case in both lines that will attach to a MagSafe Charger. Unfortunately, if you have an iPhone 13, they don't have a MagSafe case for this model yet.</p><h2 id=usability>Usability</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cellphone-in-hand-e1626369429894.jpg><p>Both cases are designed to be as unintrusive as possible. However, they do still affect how you use your phone. The first is its thickness. Adding a case can add up to 50 percent more thickness to your phone. This is especially true with the Commuter series, with its dual layers and thicker bumpers.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Best Eco-Friendly Phone Cases</a></span></p><p>A case’s thick edges can also intrude on the experience of using a phone. If you have large fingers, the Commuter’s wider bumpers might make it difficult for you to swipe up. You might also have a more difficult time reaching the silent switch because of its thicker edges.</p><p>If protection is your priority, the Commuter will outdo the Symmetry case anytime. But, if you want something a bit more stylish with more options, you should go for the latter.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=more-style-or-more-protection>More Style or More Protection?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/more-style-more-protection-1.jpg><p>Both the Symmetry and the Commuter case offer protection at roughly the same price. But you have to consider your use when choosing the best case for you. Do you need something that can withstand rough conditions? Or, do you want something that offers a bit less protection but more style?</p><p>For most everyday users, the Symmetry case is more than enough. But, if you know you have butterfingers or work in a rough and tumble environment, then the Commuter case will be the best protection for your phone.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGimrayVp6%2BwxIyssKallam%2FunnVrGScp52iwrWx0Wg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./pat-obrien-moline-6th-ward-alderman-dies.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Pat OBrien, Moline 6th ward alderman, dies</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ellen-burstyn-feels-good-at-88-i-have-no-complaints.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ellen Burstyn at 88: I Have No Complaints and Still Feel Really Good</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amal-clooney-mob-wife-trend-cream-fur-coat.html>Amal Clooney Elevates the Mob Wife Trend in a Cream Fur Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./demolition-underway-at-washington-elementary-davenport.html>Demolition underway at Washington Elementary, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iowa-man-killed-in-head-on-crash.html>Iowa man killed in head-on crash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./style-edit-richard-milles-technically-ambitious-new-rm-30-01-automatic-luxury-watch-was-inspired.html>Style Edit: Richard Milles technically ambitious new RM 30-01 Automatic luxury watch was inspired</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./463481-what-happened-frankie-lons-life-story-death.html>What happened to Frankie Lons?
