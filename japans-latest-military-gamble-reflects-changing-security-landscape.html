As part of the next-generation fighter programme, Tokyo had given up on its home-grown design, which was due to be called the F-X and, in December 2022, agreed to merge its efforts with a British-Italian programme named the Tempest. The new joint project, known as the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Global Combat Air Programme</span></a>, is based in the UK and is expected to give a big boost to Japan’s defence sector.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/23/0450aff8-02ea-4c6c-b94f-b841c36e88b3_124535c1.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The cabinet’s recent approval could also open the doors for Japan to export military hardware to countries in Southeast Asia or in other parts of the world. Japan has an extremely strong military industrial base which has not been used much since the second world war. But it has not been totally idle either.</p>Japan is actively <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">refashioning its helicopter carriers</span></a>, the Izumo and the Kaga, to be able to handle the US-made F-35B fighter aircraft. The upgrading of warships into what will effectively be its first aircraft carriers since World War II is likely to provoke a <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">backlash from neighbouring countries</span></a> like China and South Korea, with which Japan has historical animosities.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Under its plan to sell fighter jets, Japan can export only to those countries with which it has defence agreements and which are not involved in conflicts. This is easier said than done, since there is always a possibility that countries to which Japan sells these advanced fighter jets may get embroiled in conflicts later.</p>The plan could also put more pressure on Japan to actively participate in other conflicts across the world, especially in the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">South China Sea</span></a>.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/23/e3e313bd-638a-420e-b65e-4080ba157708_c272aa32.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Such weapons exports could also lead to problems on the domestic front as Komeito, a political party within Japan’s ruling coalition, has not been very keen on Japanese arms exports.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Nonetheless, the move is an important step for Japan since it is facing a variety of potential threats in the immediate neighbourhood and beyond. Already Russia and China have been working in tandem on the military front, with joint patrols both in the sea and in the air. In addition, Japan faces threats from North Korea, which has often sent missiles flying over its territory.</p>Tokyo seems to be also taking a stand in case a <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Trump administration were to come back</span></a> to power in the US. It is a given that if this happens, the US may make additional demands on Japan and other US allies to take more responsibility for their own defences, which had happened during Donald Trump’s first term in office.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Why Japan is losing sleep over nightmare of a Trump re-election</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">With the US now embroiled in conflicts from the Gaza war to the war between Ukraine and Russia, it seems Tokyo now realises that it may have to take care of its own security needs in the near future.</p>The security atmosphere around Japan is rapidly changing. It was during Abe’s tenure that Tokyo had enunciated the Free and Open Indo-Pacific initiative which aims to keep the sea lanes of communication open in the Indo-Pacific region. Japan is also an active participant of the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Quadrilateral Security Dialogue</span></a> (Quad), along with India, Australia and the United States.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Many things will undoubtedly change before these advanced fighter jets enter service by 2035. But what is certain is that Japan has certainly crossed a Rubicon when it comes to its arms export laws. There will be no going back from here on for Tokyo.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Dr Rupakjyoti Borah is a senior research fellow with the Japan Forum for Strategic Studies in Tokyo.
