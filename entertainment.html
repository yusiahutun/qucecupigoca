One of those popular shows was MacGyver, which made its debut in 1985. Created by Lee David Zlotoff and produced by Henry Winkler and John Rich, the series centered on the title character, Angus MacGyver, a secret agent who is fully armed with an unlimited supply of scientific resources and gadgets to wipe out any and all wrongdoings. Unlike other TV heroes who rely on guns and physical combat to resolve situations, MacGyver was renowned for his adept problem-solving.</p><p>MacGyver ran for seven seasons on ABC, ending in 1992, and was rebooted with a brand-new cast in 2016 on CBS. Let’s touch base with the original team and see what they’ve been up to.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Richard Dean Anderson as Angus MacGyver</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/1-2.png><p>Paging Dr. Jeff Weber! Long before becoming a primetime action hero on MacGyver, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Richard Dean Anderson</a> played the Port Charles physician on the ABC soap opera General Hospital from 1976 to 1981. After leaving the daytime drama, Anderson secured guest appearances on The Facts of Life and The Love Boat.

(Get the latest on <a href=#>Susan Dey</a>.)</p><p>When MacGyver wrapped in 1992, Anderson went on to star as Jack O’Neill in the series Stargate SG-1 from 1997 to 2007. The role earned him great respect from the military, and he was made an honorary Air Force brigadier general.</p><p>In 1995, Anderson appeared in 12 episodes of Legend. As ’80s nostalgia became popular in the ’00s, MacGyver came back into the cultural conversation, and Anderson reprised the role in a 2006 Super Bowl for MasterCard. A recurring Saturday Night Live around the time, “MacGruber” paid hilarious homage to the character and helped introduce MacGyver to a new generation.</p><p>Anderson’s most recent credits include appearances on Fairly Legal, Raising Hope and Don’t Trust the B—- in Apartment 23. Now 73, Anderson retired from acting in 2013.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Dana Elcar as Peter Thornton</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/Copy-of-Copy-of-side-by-side-e1697232177740.png><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dana Elcar</a> was a gifted character actor with a 50-year career.
