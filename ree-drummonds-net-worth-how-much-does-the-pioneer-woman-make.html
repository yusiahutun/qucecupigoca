The TV personality is worth an estimated $50 million, according to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, which doesn’t come as a surprise considering Ree is so successful.</p><p>The celebrity chef earned her hefty fortune thanks to her lucrative career, kicking it off when she began blogging about her experiences as a wife to husband <a href=#><strong>Ladd Drummond</strong></a> and a mom to their <a href=#>four kids, Alex, Paige, Bryce and Todd</a>, in 2006. Ree’s fanbase started to blow up after she was named 2010’s Weblog of the Year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ree-drummond-pioneer-woman-brady-renovation-holiday-special.jpg><p>Also in 2010, Columbia Pictures bought the film rights to Ree’s memoir, From Black Heels to Tractor Wheels, which details her life in Los Angeles to how she ended up raising her family and living on a rural ranch in Pawhuska, Oklahoma. According to <a href=#>Deadline</a>, Columbia Pictures intended to turn it into a romantic comedy starring <a href=#><strong>Reese Witherspoon</strong></a>.</p><p>Although Ree’s life was never flaunted on the big screen in a Hollywood film, saying she found success in showbiz is a complete understatement. Aside from building a massive Pioneer Woman brand, she launched the popular recipe site <a href=#>TastyKitchen.com</a> in 2008, and she’s a New York Times best-selling author.</p><p>The red-haired beauty has also made multiple appearances in shows including Throwdown! With Bobby Flay, Christmas Cookie Challenge, <a href=#>A Very Brady Renovation</a> and more. In August 2021, Ree <a href=#>announced</a> she’s set to make her acting debut in the Food Network and Discovery Plus’ first original movie titled Candy Coated Christmas in November.</p><p>There’s no denying the doting mom has an impressive résumé, but her net worth is also attributed to her longtime husband, Ladd — with whom she tied the knot in 1996. According to <a href=#>People</a>, Ree’s spouse co-owns Drummond Land & Cattle Co. with his brother, and the ranch has been in their family for five generations now.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ree-drummonds-cutest-photos-with-her-children-and-family07.jpg><p>The Drummonds own 433,000 acres of land, making the family one of the top largest landowners in the U.S. The <a href=#>Land Report</a> claimed the Bureau of Land Management has paid the Drummonds more than $23.9 million over the past decade because the family allows wild horses and burros on the property.</p><p>In addition to her profitable business as the Pioneer Woman, Ree and Ladd opened a handful of stores in Pawhuska’s downtown area. In 2016, the couple became the proud owners of a restaurant retail shop called The Merc. In 2018, they opened a bed and breakfast, called The Boarding House. On top of that, they <a href=#>run P-Town Pizza</a> and an ice cream parlor called Charlie’s Sweet Shop.</p><p>While Ree once said “it’s hard” juggling her busy career with her roles as a mom and wife, she wouldn’t trade any of it for the world. “I do the things that I really enjoy. I get a lot done when I love doing it,” she once explained to <a href=#>Design and Living</a>. “There are so many things that people are chasing me on a daily basis, and there are lots of loose ends.”</p><p>However, she forced herself to adjust to “going to bed at night and not having everything done,” added Ree, who became the mom of her <a href=#>fifth child, foster son Jamar</a>, in 2019. “My dad used to tease me that I only did what was fun, and it’s kind of true still.”</p><p>Making millions of dollars a year sounds like a ton of fun!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46rnJ5llKfCrrnOp5usZZ6awW7DzquroWWYpMRuudScn2acn5rAbsDHnmSpoZ%2Bjsqa%2BjLCmppmeYrqit8Ro</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./all-my-childrens-eva-larue-on-love-loss-and-motherhood.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>All My Children's Eva LaRue on Love, Loss and Motherhood</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./6620d2b046163f1b328b45eb-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>La promesa de Valverde a Mina Bonino por su profeca cumplida: &amp;quot;No quiero terminar en el hospital&amp;quot;</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amal-clooney-mob-wife-trend-cream-fur-coat.html>Amal Clooney Elevates the Mob Wife Trend in a Cream Fur Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./demolition-underway-at-washington-elementary-davenport.html>Demolition underway at Washington Elementary, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iowa-man-killed-in-head-on-crash.html>Iowa man killed in head-on crash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./style-edit-richard-milles-technically-ambitious-new-rm-30-01-automatic-luxury-watch-was-inspired.html>Style Edit: Richard Milles technically ambitious new RM 30-01 Automatic luxury watch was inspired</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./463481-what-happened-frankie-lons-life-story-death.html>What happened to Frankie Lons?
