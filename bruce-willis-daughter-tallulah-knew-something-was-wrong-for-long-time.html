Die Hard messed with Dad’s ears.'"</p><p>"Later that unresponsiveness broadened, and I sometimes took it personally," she admitted. "He had had two babies with my stepmother, Emma Heming Willis, and I thought he’d lost interest in me.

"What if my dad had been his full self and saw me at that size? What would he have done?" she asks in the essay.</p><p>"I’d like to think that he wouldn’t have let it happen. Whereas my sisters and my mother have these extensive tool kits—lots of psycho-education and interpersonal skills—my dad has never been so interested in root causes, in close examination.

With new tools from treatment she was able to get back to a healthy weight and began to confront what was going on with her father.</p><p>She notes in the essay that she had stored every voicemail from Bruce on a hard drive, admitting that she is "trying to document, to build a record for the day when he isn’t there to remind me of him and of us."</p><p>She writes hopefully near the end of the piece that at the moment "he still knows who I am and lights up when I enter the room."</p><p>"I keep flipping between the present and the past when I talk about Bruce: he is, he was, he is, he was," Tallulah writes. "That’s because I have hopes for my father that I’m so reluctant to let go of.
