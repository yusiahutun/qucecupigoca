The duo have worked together multiple times, with their biggest movies being La La Land, Crazy, Stupid, Love and Gangster Squad. But seeing <a href=#>Ryan Gosling</a> being in awe of his friend and co-star Emma Stone had BAFTAs viewers gushing over their <a href=#>celebrity</a> friendship.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-it-was-life-changing>‘It was life-changing’</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>During her acceptance speech at the British Academy Film and Television Awards, the Easy A star thanked her mom and the Poor Things screenwriter. She wanted to send gratitude to her mother for ‘giving her life’ and Tony McNamara for the line “I must go punch that baby” in the script.</p><p>She said the line was “life-changing”, before expressing thanks to her fellow cast and crew, director Yorgos Lanthimos and dialect coach Neil Swan.</p><p>“I was playing a British person in this movie and [Neil] did not laugh at me when he taught me how to say ‘wart-ter,’ even though as an American I say ‘wahter,’” Stone quipped. “So thank you England for accepting me.”</p><p>Emma plays Frankenstein-like Bella in Poor Things, who has been created by a reclusive doctor. Although she appears as an adult woman, she has the mental capacity of a toddler at the beginning of the film. The movie follows her as she tries to understand the world around her.</p><p>The win comes after some releases of Poor Things had adult scenes edited out, which upset the star.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ryan-gosling-winking-at-emma-stone-is-a-damn-beautiful-picture>Ryan Gosling winking at Emma Stone is a ‘damn beautiful picture’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-2020873827-1024x683.jpg><p>But it was the moment before she accepted the gold mask that had fans in tears and laughter.</p><p>A photo sees Ryan Gosling winking at <a href=#>Emma Stone</a> as she walks past in her gorgeous peach gown.
