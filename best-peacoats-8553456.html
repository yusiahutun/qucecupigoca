It's not quite as functional as a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>puffer jacket</a> for its cold weather potential, but it still works in a variety of climates, seasons, and situations. From your morning commute to a work lunch and evening date, a well-made peacoat is a great option to throw on so you can go about your busy day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Both fortunately and unfortunately, peacoats are a dime a dozen — and, since there are so many to choose from, you need to know what to look for. "A good peacoat is <strong>worth the splurge when it balances quality, functionality, and durability,</strong>" explains Stitch Fix stylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Alicia Lloyd</a>. Whether it's a more high-end wool or cashmere material or it has hidden pockets for your gloves and collar flaps to protect you from the cold, you're looking for something that is <strong>designed to keep you warm and not wear down over time</strong>. To determine the best buys, we chatted with Lloyd, designer and sewist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="nofollow nocaes">Aaronica B. Cole</a>, founder of luxury encyclopedia La Patiala <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Kristen Shirley</a>, and style expert <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel="nofollow nocaes">Naina Singla</a>. We also <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=5>tested</a> 17 of the best peacoats, from retailers including <strong>Anthropologie, L.L.Bean, Aritzia, Banana Republic, and Reformation</strong>, for even more insight.

It's a "classic" style, meaning boxy and not tailored close to the body, which makes it excellent for its <strong>layering potential</strong> (for a tighter fit, size down). It might not be for the trend-focused among us, but for those of us who want a low price-per-wear, this is an ideal choice.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Like a lot of L.L.Bean options, this <strong>feels high-quality and long-lasting</strong> (Shirley notes that their coats last "forever" and Cole likes that the brand is size-inclusive); it's definitely a step up from some of our less-expensive peacoats. The Thinsulate insulation plus wool shell (thick, soft lambswool that's not scratchy) gives it a <strong>nice warmth for a non-puffer coat</strong>. If you live in a colder climate, this would potentially be <strong>ideal for spring and fall,</strong> in other words. There are a number of pockets and thick, heavy anchor buttons. With the boxier fit, the coat can feel a little "loose" in the body when you're not layering with sweaters or cardigans underneath, so think about how you want to wear the coat before you pick your size — or, like us, order two sizes to see which one fits better.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">So, if you like buying a single,<strong> timeless item</strong> that'll last you years, this is the pick — and, if you like your coats to be on the warmer side, this is also a solid choice.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Italian lambswool, Thinsulate insulation, polyester lining | <strong>Colors:</strong> 4 | <strong>Size:</strong> 4–20; Petite 4–20; and 1X–3X</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-uniqlo-padded-short-peacoat></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Uniqlo Padded Short Peacoat</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="UNIQLO Padded Short Peacoat" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/SxVt0_tlhzgylcGeTv7Fohw9SZ0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/uniqlo-padded-short-peacoat-1870eca18f7c459daf58882bf08ef00d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>UNIQLO</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It's hard to beat the price, and the construction's still quality.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The sizing felt way off for us.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you like the look of this, you're not alone: Shirley explains, "Christophe Lemaire brings his chic Parisian stylings to the Uniqlo U collection." This is quite<strong> boxy and oversized</strong>, and we felt it particularly in the sleeve width and length (when you're on the edge between two sizes, pick the smaller one — and don't pay attention to Mysize Assist, which may steer you towards an even larger size). With that said, though, and in keeping with a lot of UNIQLO's offerings, this is a well-made coat, particularly for the price. The <strong>shorter style</strong> is a nice throw-on coat option, and there's tons of room for layering.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Construction-wise, there’s an<strong> extra neck flap</strong> that can help protect from the cold, and the coat felt <strong>breathable</strong> without being stuffy. We also loved the <strong>hidden pocket </strong>(inside, left breast), which is perfect for glove storage and isn't something you always see on women's coats. The fact that it's lined with "square quilted flannel fabric," as described on the website, means there's added warmth without added bulk.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our final take: this is <strong>a good transitional coat </strong>or travel coat depending on your needs, but it's perhaps not a coat for the cold months. Pay close attention to sizing, and know that it might take a few tries before you find your perfect fit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Cotton, polyester, nylon | <strong>Colors:</strong> 2 | <strong>Size:</strong> XXS–XL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-cold-weather-mango-oversize-wool-coat></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Cold Weather</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Mango Oversize Wool Coat</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Mango Oversize Wool Coat" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/eyTqz7-g6ZZCbRL4r5_iv84NAIs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/mango-oversize-wool-coat-b46c246734cd4e8ea555ac8b3109fd0e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Mango</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It's long and warm and doesn't require layers underneath.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>You may need to size it way down and/or tailor it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When Mango describes this as <strong>"oversized,"</strong> there’s no exaggeration. It felt huge in length and dimensions, even after ordering one size smaller than our normal size. Order one size down and two sizes down if you want to do a comparison; also, know that you might need to do some tailoring even after you buy. <strong>It's long</strong>, which means that on shorter folks, it might feel very, very long (and the buttons and pockets might not hit the right spot on your body).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The coat itself is nicely <strong>heavyweight</strong>, particularly for the cost — it's not terribly breathable, but it's warmer than your average peacoat. It's lined, too, and we felt warm and toasty when we tested the coat in a variety of environments. It might not be for heavy layering, per se, but if you need a coat that keeps the cold out without being bulky, this is your pick. The fabric is soft, and the wool is thick without being scratchy — so this works nicely as an occasion coat, too, since it <strong>looks and feels luxe</strong>. In other words: you could throw this over a dress or nice outfit and feel great in the colder months.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Polyester, recycled wool,&nbsp; polyamide,&nbsp; acrylic, cotton, viscose | <strong>Colors:</strong> 2 | <strong>Size:</strong> XXS–XXL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-short-banana-republic-classic-peacoat></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Short</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Banana Republic Classic Peacoat</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Banana Republic Classic Peacoat" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/BipgifePKv09Xsh_kwiSNCe1uhg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/banana-republic-classic-peacoat-0ea20d6b543e42b28f9bdc04fc22f014.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Banana Republic</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It's about as chic and structured as a peacoat can get.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It doesn't accommodate a lot of bulk underneath.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This runs true to size but is slim, so just bear that in mind when you pick your size. We loved the shorter length — which hit right at the hips for us — and the coat is <strong>incredibly warm despite not feeling terribly thick</strong>. It's probably not ideal for layering, and we couldn't get super thick sweaters under it, but it works perfectly with a thin sweater. With that in mind, we recommend this for fall and spring, and in any transitional weather.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">What's nice about this option is its chicness, and we felt like we could throw on the coat and head out the door looking <strong>polished </strong>(even when our outfit underneath was supremely casual). The buttons are large and substantial, and the<strong> pockets are deep</strong> and slanted — perfect for putting in your essential items and not having to worry about them falling out. The lining is silky and luxurious, which is a nice touch. In our opinion, this is <strong>an ideal city coat</strong>: it helped us feel a bit dressy and put-together without a whole lot of effort, and it would have taken us to work meetings, dinners, and sightseeing without looking out of place. It looks high-maintenance, but is actually <strong>low-maintenance</strong> — the dream!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Polyester | <strong>Colors:</strong> 1 | <strong>Size:</strong> XS–XL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-long-reformation-paley-double-breasted-coat></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Long</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Reformation Paley Double Breasted Coat</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Reformation Paley Double Breasted Coat" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/VQgcxWS5MOhIbphTRUYXEcEdppo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/reformation-paley-double-breasted-coat-f85c9b2067834c5fa404d0bd94a9a9af.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Reformation</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It might be an oversized style, but it's not big, bulky, or overwhelming.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Reformation's not cheap.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We wore this in a number of different contexts and with a bunch of outfits, and this coat looked great no matter what. The coat is roomy, meaning you can still layer with bigger sweaters, but the <strong>structured design</strong> meant we didn't feel like we were drowning in it (and the sleeves were actually the perfect length). Get your regular size, despite the site calling the style "roomy." It looks fabulous closed or open, if you want to show off your outfit on your commute.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>The flap pockets are high quality and deep </strong>enough that you can hide the flap inside the pocket if you prefer a sleeker look. The lining's high-quality too and feels luxe. Even for those of us who are short, the jacket fits well and hits a nice spot at the bottom (mid-shin). We felt this would be perfect for fall and mild winter days, although it might be a bit <strong>too heavy for spring</strong>. It’s a nice "one and done" coat: Take it with you on a work trip or for a cold-weather vacation, and it'll suit your aesthetic no matter what you're doing. And, even though it's designed to look big, it's actually tailored to perfection. "If you're looking to add a statement coat to your wardrobe, this is the one to add," says Singla.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong>&nbsp; Recycled MWool, recycled polyamide, and polyamide | <strong>Colors:</strong> 2 | <strong>Size:</strong> XS–XL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-oversized-zara-soft-oversized-coat></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Oversized</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Zara Soft Oversized Coat</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Zara Soft Oversized Coat" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/aIEWU37w0mD4iqsK8X3PROMWt7o=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/zara-soft-oversized-coat-3b6677c12e6642f9aef877d20e53e40a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Zara</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It's versatile, chic, and (perhaps most importantly) great value.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The buttons don't feel terribly well-secured or high-quality.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We loved wearing this for a full day's worth of activities — it was just that comfy-cozy (if you're unfamiliar, Zara usually nails their coat design and construction).<strong> If you don't want oversized, size down</strong>, which is what we did to great effect. For those of us on the shorter side, it hit about mid-shin and looks good open or closed. It's warm (meaning <strong>heavyweight</strong>) and snuggly, even though it's polyester, and worked well in wind, rain, and generally inclement weather. It's <strong>not waterproof,</strong> but it's still durable.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We particularly loved the v-neck, double-breasted design — meaning, it's <strong>easy to close over any manner of outfits</strong>, and can accommodate a scarf nicely — and we'd choose it as one step lighter than a down or puffer jacket. What we really loved, though, was the <strong>value for money</strong>. We didn't expect the weight and quality to be this good for the price. The buttons do feel a bit flimsy and not terribly well-secured, but that's fixable with some tailoring (or some DIY if you know how). Ultimately, this is a nice “starter peacoat” — if you'd prefer not to splurge because you're just trying out the style, in other words, this is a great (and not too expensive) way to get in on the style.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Polyester | <strong>Colors:</strong> 3 | <strong>Size:</strong> XXS–XXL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-puffy-j-crew-peacoat-puffer-jacket-in-lightweight-shiny-nylon></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Puffy</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>J.

It's a lovely length for a puffer jacket (while still having the structure of a peacoat — which is a cool, unique look, by the way). As such, we found it perfectly warm — it <strong>keeps out the wind and traps in some heat</strong> but doesn't feel overly stuffy and remains breathable. Perhaps most importantly, the coat doesn't feel bulky despite its official puffer status.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The jacket is <strong>soft to the touch</strong> and comes in two nice neutral colors. It has buttonholes on the left and right, meaning you can button it on either side, and is an especially cool feature. The <strong>lining feels silky</strong>, which is especially nice when you only have a T-shirt underneath. We felt the coat looked “fancy,” meaning it could dress up a casual look and pair nicely with a dressy look, but perhaps wouldn't be the pick for an active hike or other sporting activity.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This isn't the cheapest option on the list, which means it's an investment, but the <strong>classic shape and structure</strong> — with just a hint of cool factor — means <strong>the price-per-wear is low</strong>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Recycled polyamide | <strong>Colors:</strong> 2 | <strong>Size:</strong> XXXS–XXL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-belted-avec-les-filles-wool-blend-belted-shawl-collar-peacoat></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Belted</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Avec Les Filles Wool Blend Belted Peacoat</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Avec Les Filles Wool Blend Belted Shawl Collar Peacoat" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/YRJeRM22hhCXHJ5g9dcjnZ7UyZc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/avec-les-filles-wool-blend-belted-shawl-collar-peacoat-a9a6960001ab481f9d98dd0aec168725.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Avec Les Filles</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Because it's a wrap, this coat will adjust to whatever layers you have under it.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The existing belt makes the coat feel a bit “robe-like.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This was an amazing commute coat (which was about 40 minutes one way, if you're wondering) because it functioned well as a wrap coat with <strong>a highly adjustable waist</strong>. This ran true to size, if a little long in the sleeves and loose in the ribcage, and was <strong>warm without being too hot.</strong> It's a great transitional, everyday piece, and works well with layering. We wore it in rain and inclement weather, but we wouldn't recommend it for when the elements are really intense.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The <strong>jacket material was our favorite part </strong>(soft and luxurious), although we needed to work a little harder than usual to keep the lighter color clean. The <strong>larger collar and tie belt </strong>can feel a little bathrobe-y, so we sometimes put the tie in the pockets of the jacket and wore it open (although, alternatively, this coat would work well if you replaced the belt with something more structured). Wrinkles can be a bit tough to get out, but dry cleaning is recommended, anyway. In short, this is one of those pieces that <strong>works well if you're hoping for something versatile, but it might require some tweaks to make it look perfect for your outfit</strong> and body type. With that said, though, it's a comfy and multifunctional piece, and Singla notes that it gives a “quiet luxury feel.” Lloyd likes Avec Les Filles’ peacoat options as “<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">wardrobe builders</a>,” since they are versatile and can be worn with items you already own for a variety of occasions.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Polyester, wool | <strong>Colors:</strong> 2 | <strong>Size:</strong> XS–XL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-plaid-anthropologie-maeve-plaid-peacoat></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Plaid</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Anthropologie Maeve Plaid Peacoat</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Anthropologie Maeve Plaid Peacoat" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/6R2d4-BOMP2MWAVgWQU5TzfoTaA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/anthropologie-maeve-plaid-peacoat-7ab84429519148ab8fb4c10de8254cc4.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Anthropologie</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It has a classic look and feel that can be dressed up and down.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The sleeves feel tight with bulkier tops.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This coat works beautifully for a multitude of everyday activities, from our commute to dinners to grocery shopping and walks. It runs true to size (the coat, particularly in the arms, gets tight with bulkier layers, so be mindful of that) and remains <strong>breathable</strong>. It's a longer length and hits right at the knee for us, so is perfect for the cold. It may not be the most practical for intense activities — shoveling snow, for example. But this stood up well against previous puffer coats we've owned that were much heavier.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The plaid pattern was one of our favorite parts — it felt very luxe and was a true knit — and the <strong>lining was soft on our skin</strong>. The pockets are large, which is always a nice plus, and it's a nice <strong>balance between dressy and casual</strong>, depending on what you wear underneath (generally, this coat helped us obtain professional/Parisian/librarian outfit vibes, which is always a treat). In other words, this is a great “fashion” peacoat that, despite a little bit of tightness in the arms when we layer, remains incredibly versatile for this type of item. Cole adds, "This screams, 'I'm standing on business — classy business.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Polyester, viscose, elastane | <strong>Colors:</strong> 1 | <strong>Size:</strong> XXS–XL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-dressy-babaton-the-constant-coat></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Dressy</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Babaton The Constant Coat</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Babaton The Constant Coat" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/6WINfXUz5vOsyZPgTOHVWxEKAf8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/babaton-the-constant-coat-ea18ac075ddf410eb932e519a86275ca.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Babaton</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It's designed to perfection for a stylish fit.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>We've said it before, but this is a true investment piece, so it'll cost more.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Unlike others on this list, this jacket isn't designed to be oversized — so, pick your true size, and recognize that<strong> </strong>it <strong>fits slim</strong>. With all that said, though, it already looked perfectly tailored to us when it arrived; it could also fit a bulkier sweater underneath without feeling tight. It fit even for those of us who are short (down to mid-calf at the bottom) and gave a <strong>chic, streamlined, lengthening silhouette </strong>when we had it on.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The <strong>warmth and quality of the material </strong>are among the piece's greatest selling points, and the lining gives an extra touch of luxury. It accommodates a scarf well because of the V-neck collar, which we used on colder days; however, it's worth noting that you may need the scarf in colder weather as the low cut of the coat doesn't protect the neck. Even after several weeks, it looked as good as new and had <strong>zero wear and tear</strong>. Obviously, the price point is higher than some of the others on this list, but the price-per-wear will be low — seriously, we wore it with everything — and the quality matches or even exceeds the price. Shirley notes, “The Constant Coat will keep you <strong>toasty in temps as low as -4 degrees</strong>, so you can give your winter parka a break or feel stylish at elegant events."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Virgin wool, cashmere, viscose; polyester, elastane | <strong>Colors:</strong> 4 | <strong>Size:</strong> 2XS–XL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><li><strong>Fabric and Material: </strong>Specifically, what is the fabric or “mix” of fabrics making up your coat? "At the very high end, a coat will be crafted from cashmere. Mid-price points generally feature wool blends. More expensive ones are wool-cashmere blends, while less expensive coats tend to be wool-polyester blends or 100 percent polyester,” explains Shirley. “If the coat is a wool-polyester blend, you should look for the highest percentage of wool you can afford. If it’s a cheap blend that is primarily polyester, it likely won’t be as comfortable or last as long.” Cole does note, though, that “I don't love the way acrylics feel on my skin but if you're allergic to wool, this is a good option to have. “Also, look at the lining — if it is lined — and what it's made of.</li><li><strong>Fit: </strong>“A peacoat should not be too oversized or too fitted — it should allow for easy movement,” says Singla. “If a peacoat is too long it will lose its shape, and a peacoat that is too short will make you look rounder than you actually are. Sleeves should extend to the top of the arms when you're standing up.” Also: Can you lift up your arms comfortably? Can you layer underneath? “I have broader shoulders, and many coats are uncomfortably tight once I put on a thick sweater,” says Shirley. “To avoid this, I always bring a bulky sweater with me when coat shopping.”</li><li><strong>Design: </strong>Are you looking for oversized or fitted? Long or short? Do you want to protect your neck (don't buy a V-neck jacket unless you always want to wear a scarf with it!) It might sound small, says Shirley, but make sure you like the construction and placement of the pockets, the better to shove your hands in when it gets cold. Pay careful attention to the stitching and quality of the buttons, says Singla. Even if it's not perfect when you order it, there are still opportunities to make it suit you. “I would recommend having your jacket tailored — especially if you're a plus-sized beauty,” says Cole. “If your measurements are pretty standard, tailoring may not be necessary, but most of us aren't and we still deserve to be cute and cozy.”</li><li><strong>Garment Care: </strong>Jackets are going to get dirty, and a lot of peacoats are dry clean only. "Be honest with yourself and how you’ll wear it,” says Shirley. “I once owned a beautiful white peacoat that I destroyed the first time I wore it by spilling food on my sleeve at an outdoor gathering. The dry cleaner couldn’t completely get out the stain, and I was absolutely devastated.”</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Why are peacoats so expensive?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Because the best peacoats are warm and long-lasting, explains Singla, their materials are going to be higher-end — which can sometimes mean more expensive: “Traditionally, peacoats are made from wool, and wool provides excellent insulation. Cashmere blend is another option that provides more softness.” Adds Lloyd, “The longevity of a peacoat is enhanced by sturdy construction, reinforced seams, and durable fabrics.” There are less expensive options out there, but don't expect them to last as long or be as warm. Sometimes an investment really does make sense.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Are peacoats actually warm?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">They can be! They're usually not as warm as a down or puffer jacket, but they can come close thanks to innovations in construction. If you live in a rainy climate, opt for a water-resistant or repellent outer material (the latter might be hard to find, though, since wool isn't really water-repellent). Shirley notes that some brands test their coats to certain temperatures, so if you need it to really keep you warm, opt for a peacoat that is cold-weather tested.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Avoid synthetic fabrics, poor stitching, and overly bulky designs — these may wear down faster,” says Lloyd. “Opt for a jacket with natural insulating materials like down or high-quality wool.” She appreciates the quality peacoat for its layering potential, and espouses the Stitch Fix-coined “<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">three layer rule</a>” for optimal layering: “Start by selecting a lightweight base layer, such as a cotton T-shirt, add a cozy mid-layer like a knit cardigan, and finish the look with an oversized peacoat.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Are peacoats still in style?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Certain styles of coat can be “trendy,” but a peacoat is pretty classic regardless of what's in fashion. With that said, though, there are ways to pull in a trendy shape or color. "When it comes time to make a statement, go for the duster length in a bright, bold color or abstract print," says Cole. "If you're looking for a more classy, elegant look, I would look at the midi to mid-thigh lengths in navy blue, black, or camel.” You can also play with shape, adds Singla: "Oversized peacoats are good for layering and if you like a more relaxed, casual style." Adds Lloyd, when in doubt, you can always add in a pattern. “Stitch Fix <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">found</a> that 55 percent of clients say they are most interested in incorporating plaid styles in 2024.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us&nbsp;</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Katherine J.
