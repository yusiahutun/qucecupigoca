The most adventurous new shapes still have an approachable element, with adjustable ties and strategically-placed cutouts; the colors, patterns, and hints of shimmer look like vacation, but feel versatile enough to mix with daytime clothes at home. And when I want to stick with my personal status quo, the little black one-piece has swimwear insiders' stamp of approval.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The 2023 swimwear trends worth shopping ahead come with styling insight from experts at Farfetch, Shopbop, and Monday Swimwear, each to help you get out of your comfort zone or lean all the way into it with a new-but-familiar silhouette. Each look ahead can speak to every way of luxuriating under the summer sun, and at every size.

"Minimal swimwear is trending for 2023 and beyond," Maguire says. "This trend has longevity as it's incredibly versatile and can be paired with various cover-ups."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Taking the understated route doesn't always signal a classic black one-piece (though the style is editor approved). <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://mondayswimwear.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Monday Swimwear" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Monday Swimwear</a> founders Natasha Oakley and Devin Brugman demonstrated how to do timeless swimwear in a way that's still playful and a little feminine, with cheekier bottoms, structured tops, and a rich palette. "[O]ur new favorite shapes lean on chic silhouettes, playing with different hardware in unexpected colors with the perfect beachwear piece to complete the look," they add. The two-tone bikini below checks all their boxes for a timeless, minimal look.</p><h2 data-node-id title="2023 Swimwear Trend: Twists and Cutouts" data-anchor-id=2023-swimwear-trend-twists-and-cutouts class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emt9r7s1">2023 Swimwear Trend: Twists and Cutouts</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Easy boxes like "one-piece" and "two-piece" were made to be disrupted; this summer, there's no shortage of adventurously cropped and draped swimsuits to swap in for the classics.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I really enjoying seeing designers challenge traditional swimwear silhouettes, looking beyond classic cuts associated with the category and offering unexpected shapes," Farfetch's Celenie Seidel says. She points to Christopher Esber as a leader in all things cut-out, cropped, and twisted: Just like the designer's ready-to-wear, his swimwear is always adventurous and generous with showing skin. Twisted straps and expansive cutouts are an invitation to get creative with layering: "Any of these make for really fresh beach style in any location, and can conveniently be worked together with ready-to-wear pieces for effortless vacation dressing," Siedel adds.</p><h2 data-node-id title="2023 Swimwear Trend: Mermaid Motifs" data-anchor-id=2023-swimwear-trend-mermaid-motifs class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emt9r7s1">2023 Swimwear Trend: Mermaid Motifs</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There's nowhere better to experiment with 2023's <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/trends/a40797920/mermaidcore-resort-trend/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="mermaidcore trend" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">mermaidcore trend</a> than swimwear.

"I'm excited to see the return of halter silhouettes this season! It's a throwback style that feels fresh again," she says. Maguire's expert-recommended picks include Ganni's swirling printed one-piece and Staud's chocolate maillot with a beaded strap.</p><h2 data-node-id title="2023 Swimwear Trend: Glittery Fabrics" data-anchor-id=2023-swimwear-trend-glittery-fabrics class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emt9r7s1">2023 Swimwear Trend: Glittery Fabrics<br></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This year, your summer glow can start with a shimmery swimsuit. One-pieces and bikinis in all cuts and colors are threaded with hints of shine to catch the light wherever you spend the season. For some IYKYK credit, go for Oséree; the label's glistening swimsuits are fashion insider-approved.</p><h2 data-node-id title="2023 Swimwear Trend: One-Shoulder Suits" data-anchor-id=2023-swimwear-trend-one-shoulder-suits class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emt9r7s1">2023 Swimwear Trend: One-Shoulder Suits</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I was relieved to see plenty of one-shoulder swimsuits in this summer's swimwear collections. They're the kind of design balancing act that won't get in the way of an active day at the beach or the pool: a little revealing, but totally wearable. Try a streamlined bikini like Anemos' to double-dip with this summer's minimalist movement, or get the effect of a vibrant two-piece in a colorblock version like J.Crew's.</p><span data-node-id=30>..</span><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/harpersbazaar/static/images/logos/lettermark.934d28d.svg?primary=%2523000" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=100 width=100 alt=Lettermark style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Halie LeSavage is the fashion commerce editor at Harper's BAZAAR.
