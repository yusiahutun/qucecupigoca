Immediately, fans became mesmerized by his handsome, bearded appearance, which left the ladies <a href=#>thirsting over him</a>.</p><p>Months later, the dark and handsome Lamine “Enimal” Diop made headlines again, joining the Twitter conversation of HBO’s “Insecure” during the premiere episode of the second season.</p><p>While <a href=#>cheering</a> for his sister, fans couldn’t help but notice his outstanding looks. A glimpse into his social media showed just how gorgeous he was in real life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Issa-Rae-Brother-Liam-Diop.jpg><p>Standing at 6 feet and 6 inches, with a full face of nicely groomed beards and an iconic smile, he easily stood out as the dream guy. The discovery that he was pursuing a music career made Issa Rae’s brother even more appealing.</p><p>Having somewhat similar interests with his sister and respective showbiz careers, one would think their paths would cross more often – at least more than a random run-in at a party. That leaves the question of how close the siblings really are in real life.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Does_Issa_Rae_Have_A_Great_Relationship_With_Her_Brother></span><strong>Does Issa Rae Have A Great Relationship With Her Brother?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Going by <a href=#>pictures</a> of Issa Rae and her brother posing together, which have surfaced over the years, the siblings seem to have a close-knit relationship.</p><p>From their smiley faces that prove they enjoyed each other’s company to lauding each other’s accomplishments, the duo appears to share an amazing sibling bond. He also appeared on several episodes of his sister’s HBO comedy, spotlighting his own career.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>However, their closeness came into question following a 2019 <a href=#>interview</a> the musician granted following his sister’s engagement to Louis Diame. At the time, he claimed he never knew of his sister’s lowkey engagement until days later. Hence, despite being a family member, he was in the dark, just like the rest of the world.</p><p>Rae, whose real name is Jo-Issa Rae Diop, first sparked engagement rumors after appearing on the cover of Essence magazine in 2019, flaunting a massive sparkler. The actress failed to address the speculation, letting fans’ imaginations run wild.</p><p>Thankfully, Lamine Diop saved the day by confirming his sister’s engagement in an interview while spilling some major tea about his sister and her partner.</p><p>These revelations, although welcomed, sent mixed signals. Many believed the usually private actress would not appreciate her brother sharing details about her private life, especially after she previously side-lined the subject.</p><p>Whether that created a rift between them or not remains unknown, as the two continue living their lives as a happy family.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Everything_Lamine_Diop_Said_About_His_Sisters_Engagement></span><strong>Everything Lamine Diop Said About His Sister’s Engagement</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Issa-Rae-Louis-Diame-1024x704.jpg><p>After weeks of speculation about Issa Rae’s engagement, Diop stepped forward to break the ice. During the Los Angeles premiere of “Little,” in 2019, his excitement seemed to run wild as he confirmed the engagement rumors and more. Speaking to interviewers, he <a href=#>said</a>:</p><p><strong>“They did it around the holidays. She’s so low-key too, for real! I found out, like a couple days later, so we’re just gonna let her lead the way.”</strong></p><p>Despite her not breaking the engagement news sooner, Diop did not seem to mind knowing his sister’s personality. He explained how excited he was that Rae finally found the one in Louis Diame.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Diop_Said_Of_His_Sisters_Success></span><strong>What Diop Said Of His Sister’s Success</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Going further, Lamine Diop revealed he and the rest of the family were always excited to celebrate all of the actress’s accolades. He <a href=#>added</a>:</p><p><strong>“They keep rolling in and we’re trying to keep up.”</strong></p><p>The singer was referencing his sister’s back-to-back success, from her hit YouTube series, “The Mis-Adventures of Awkward Black Girl,” to her breakout on HBO’s “Insecure.”</p><p>So far, Rae’s on-screen performances have earned her awards like the NAACP Image Awards, the BET Award, Satellite Award and the 2022 PGA Visionary Vanguard Award among others.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Issa_Rae_Thinks_Of_Fans_Obsession_With_Her_Brother></span><strong>What Issa Rae Thinks Of Fan’s Obsession With Her Brother</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Lamine “Enimal” Diop also touched on the fan craze that has surrounded him since his identity as Issa Rae’s brother became public. While the media attention has certainly drawn more attention to his career, the focus on his good looks admittedly throws her off. He <a href=#>divulged</a>:</p><p><strong>“My sister is disgusted by it. Like… ‘This is the grossest website article ever!’”</strong></p><p>Despite his sister’s opinion, the rapper admittedly loved such articles, describing them as quality journalism while urging news outlets to keep them coming.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Issa-Rae-and-her-brother.webp><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Diops_Thoughts_About_His_Sisters_Husband></span><strong>Diop’s Thoughts About His Sister’s Husband</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>During his interview at the “Little” premiere, the handsome brother of Issa Rae also dished on Louis Diame’s personality. He described his sister’s husband as a good guy, <a href=#>adding</a>:</p><p><strong>“He’s just a cool guy. They’ve been dating forever. He’s already been like a brother to me. Family ties at all the family events and dinners, Christmas, Thanksgiving.”</strong></p><p>Issa rae and Louise Diame eventually <a href=#>tied the knot</a> in a secret ceremony in 2021. So far, the actress appears to be enjoying every bit of her life as Diame’s wife.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51ksbB5yKyqmmWilrJurc2dZKGdomKvs7vToZyrZZiWw6Z5wGaapaejmnqzscuaq6Knnqi1qryMnq2eqqmptaq6xmajmqWZo7Juv8Cim2aZkqTCtXnHoqpmnpGivLa%2FjKygrKyVp3w%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./larsa-pippen-casual-cool-hoodie-sweatpants-la-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Larsa Pippen is casual cool in black hoodie and grey sweatpants as she takes her dog for a walk in L</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ben-roberts-smith-trial-army-slang-terms-spotters-squirters-blooding-kill-boards-explained-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ben Roberts-Smith trial army slang terms spotters, squirters, blooding and kill boards explained</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amal-clooney-mob-wife-trend-cream-fur-coat.html>Amal Clooney Elevates the Mob Wife Trend in a Cream Fur Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./demolition-underway-at-washington-elementary-davenport.html>Demolition underway at Washington Elementary, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iowa-man-killed-in-head-on-crash.html>Iowa man killed in head-on crash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./style-edit-richard-milles-technically-ambitious-new-rm-30-01-automatic-luxury-watch-was-inspired.html>Style Edit: Richard Milles technically ambitious new RM 30-01 Automatic luxury watch was inspired</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./463481-what-happened-frankie-lons-life-story-death.html>What happened to Frankie Lons?
