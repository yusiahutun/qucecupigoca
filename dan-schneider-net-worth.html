The two discuss the allegations and the Quiet On Set documentary. “When I watched the show, I could see the hurt in some people’s eyes, and it made me feel awful and regretful and sorry. I wish I could go back, especially to those earlier years of my career, and bring the growth and the experience that I have now and just do a better job and never, ever feel like it was OK to be an asshole to anyone, ever.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"></figure><p>Schneider directly addressed Drake Bell’s lawsuit against Brian Peck who sexually abused him while they were workinng together.“When Drake and I talked and he told me about what happened, I was more devastated by that than anything that ever happened to me in my career thus far. And I told him, ‘I’m here for you,’</p><p>He continued, “That was probably the darkest part of my career,” Schneider said. “And here’s the kicker that I really don’t get. After [Peck] got out of prison and was a registered sex offender, he was hired on a&nbsp;Disney Channel&nbsp;show. I don’t understand that.”</p><p>“All those jokes … the show covered over the past two nights, every one of those jokes was written for a kid audience because kids thought they were funny and only funny,” &nbsp;he argued. But that was then. “Let’s cut those jokes out of the show, just like I would have done 20 years ago or 25 years ago,” he says. “I want my shows to be popular. I want everyone to like [the shows], the more people who liked the shows, the happier I am. So if there’s anything that needs to be cut because it’s upsetting somebody, let’s cut it.”</p><p>“There are definitely things that I would do differently,” he said, including having licensed therapists on set to oversee child actors and the filming process. “The main thing that I would change is how I treat people and everyone. I definitely at times didn’t give people the best of me. I didn’t show enough patience. I could be cocky and definitely over-ambitious, and sometimes just straight up rude and obnoxious, and I’m sorry that I ever was.”</p><p>Two former Nickelodeon writers Christy Stratton and Jenny Kilgen, the only women writers to work on season one of the&nbsp;Nickelodeon&nbsp;sitcom&nbsp;The Amanda Show, came forward with claims that they had to split a salary to work on the show. The writers also claimed that Schneider showed them pornography while on the job and asked for massages. In response to that, Schneider said in the video about the massages. “It was wrong. It was wrong that I ever put anyone in that position. It was wrong to do. I’d never do it today. I’m embarrassed that I did it then. I apologize to anybody that I ever put in that situation.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfma6vedKcn6edmZmys3nNnqtmr5%2Bnwal7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./free-film-at-the-figge-focuses-on-coming-of-age-movies.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Free Film at the Figge focuses on coming-of-age movies</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./blackpink-iu-han-so-hee-mbti-2023.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>BlackpinkMBTI16MBTI</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amal-clooney-mob-wife-trend-cream-fur-coat.html>Amal Clooney Elevates the Mob Wife Trend in a Cream Fur Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./demolition-underway-at-washington-elementary-davenport.html>Demolition underway at Washington Elementary, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iowa-man-killed-in-head-on-crash.html>Iowa man killed in head-on crash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./style-edit-richard-milles-technically-ambitious-new-rm-30-01-automatic-luxury-watch-was-inspired.html>Style Edit: Richard Milles technically ambitious new RM 30-01 Automatic luxury watch was inspired</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./463481-what-happened-frankie-lons-life-story-death.html>What happened to Frankie Lons?
