Unfortunately, as the officers were moving in the thicket looking for the possible location of the guns, they were met by gunfire from other robbers that had escaped. I think this is what prompted the officers to take cover and engage the other group in the exchange of fire. It is in the process that the two other suspects were fatally injured. The issue that the two suspects were killed by our officers is not true," said Shishia.<p class=align-left>Their bodies were taken to Murang'a Level V Hospital mortuary awaiting identification.</p><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnC3xKewmmeTpMKvwMieqmhsaW2AeIOMpqyrmZ6crm6uwKeiZqqfl6%2Bmvthmqq6roJqwtb%2BMpKClpJWZeqjBzZ%2Bgq51dmsWktMCnnp5loKS5qq%2FEZqafnpmYsrN7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sarah-michelle-gellar-tiny-strapless-bikini-makeup-free.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Sarah Michelle Gellar slays the bikini selfie in phenomenal makeup-free photo</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./michael-j-pollard.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Michael J.
