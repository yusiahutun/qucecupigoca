Her popularity on YouTube and in social media circles is growing astronomically as her page views and followers increase millions of times a day. Her friend and darling, Lance Stewart, who is also a YouTube star with a fan base of his own, introduced her to vlogging when she first appeared on his channel before she carved out her niche. Read on for everything you need to know about her, including her height, body statistics, biography, and more.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Lizzy Wurst Biography/Wiki/Social Media</strong></h2><p>The beautiful Elizabeth Wurst is a young and promising YouTube blogger who was born on July 22, 1998, in the United States of America. She is a native American of white ethnicity and her star sign is cancer. She attended Delsea High School in New Jersey but currently lives in Los Angeles. She began publishing videos about the grapevine, where she had thousands of followers before the grapevine was closed down. She has a younger brother who sometimes appears in her videos.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Prince – Cause Of Death, Height, Net Worth, Wiki, Wife, Gay, Sister, Son, Family</a></strong></p><p>Lizzy, as she prefers to be called, became popular on Twitter with up to a million followers. Her personality on Twitter, where she posts funny stuff and short songs, earned her a million followers. Lizzy Wurst was introduced on YouTube by Lance Stewart, and she currently has just over a million subscribers. On YouTube, she posts videos weekly and gets many hits and preferences. She is reportedly earning up to $75,000 a year in YouTube ads based on the number of hits she receives each day. A few years ago she suffered from breast cancer and talked about her uncertainties about her breast size and how it had shrunk in the years before plastic surgery.</p><p>She published the hottest pepper challenge in 2016, which became truly viral and was broadcast on other popular channels. Since then, she has published more videos about the challenge, ranging from the extreme Cinnamon Challenge to the extreme Yoga Challenge. She has become a YouTube star mainly because she does her vlogs, comedy clips, lifestyle updates, pranks, and just posts stuff. People are attracted to her online world because everyone loves a good laugh and would do anything to get one. She introduces other YouTube stars on her channel, like Sabrina, Lance, and the great Niki.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Mom, Net Worth</strong></h2><p>Not much is known about Lizzy Wurst mother, who is known as Maria Wurst (her father’s first name is Tom, by the way). She first became a person of interest to the Internet world when she allegedly sent Lizzy Wurst out of the house, when Lizzy Wurst allegedly refused to yell at her on her channel, and because she refused to help her mother advertise on her new channel, which has far fewer subscribers than her Lizzys. It was Lizzy’s boyfriend who made this public when he released a video of his crying girlfriend.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Tommy Chong Dead, Net Worth, Parents, Wife, Kids, Wiki</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Is Lizzy Wurst Dating? Boyfriend</strong></h2><p>Lizzy Wurst is not married and has no children, but she is very much in a relationship. She’s dating Lance Stewart, who she met in high school. In one of her videos “The Boyfriend Tag”, she talks about how they met on the sidewalks across the street, how sweet she thought he was cute and wanted to talk to him; how she tried very hard to find out his name and finally stumbled upon his Instagram page, followed him for a while and sent him a message telling him how cute he looked. Everything then seemed to start from there. The couple went out for a date, Lance later asked her to be his girlfriend with a bouquet. She said yes, and they’ve been together ever since.</p><p>Lance is also a big YouTube personality. He motivated his girlfriend to launch her channel in 2016 and it was a success story on both fronts. He has over 1.7 million followers on YouTube and millions of followers on Instagram. He officially launched his YouTube channel in 2014. The two lovebirds often do vlogs together. Lance not only post daily vlogs on his two channels but also took care of the homeless by feeding them.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Height, Body Measurements</strong></h2><p>In a question-and-answer video, Lizzy said she was five feet and maybe an inch tall. But because she is petite, her height is listed on various celebrity websites as 5 feet 3 inches, which is the equivalent of 160 m. Lizzy Wurst has a slim build and weighs 59 kg or 130 pounds. Her height is 34-26-34 inches. She has blond hair and blue eyes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51kuarG2bJksK2iqMFursionquZoJ3GbsPIpKBmnJGptq%2BzjJumsp6inrKvsIympqZlmJq2qLTTZpmonKliuqat0q6pnqWVo8G0ew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./retired-farmer-dead-slurry-pit-took-life-hours-changing-will-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Retired farmer found dead in slurry pit took his own life hours after changing his will</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./heartstopper-recap-season-2-episode-7-sorry-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Heartstopper Recap: Something Good</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amal-clooney-mob-wife-trend-cream-fur-coat.html>Amal Clooney Elevates the Mob Wife Trend in a Cream Fur Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./demolition-underway-at-washington-elementary-davenport.html>Demolition underway at Washington Elementary, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iowa-man-killed-in-head-on-crash.html>Iowa man killed in head-on crash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./style-edit-richard-milles-technically-ambitious-new-rm-30-01-automatic-luxury-watch-was-inspired.html>Style Edit: Richard Milles technically ambitious new RM 30-01 Automatic luxury watch was inspired</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./463481-what-happened-frankie-lons-life-story-death.html>What happened to Frankie Lons?
