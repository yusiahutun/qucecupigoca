First, improving immunity helps us avoid bothersome colds and infections. And boosting our digestive function may make tummy troubles a thing of the past. So, where do we begin? Eating more gut and immune-boosting foods — like fruits, veggies, and whole grains — is a great place to start. Also, if you need a little boost, it’s worth giving herbal supplements and infusions a go!</p><p>To learn more about the benefits of supplements, we spoke with Paul Schulick, herbalist and founder of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">For the Biome</a>, about the importance of maintaining a healthy gut microbiome. Schulick offers insight on how you can take care of your microbiome on a daily basis with supplements and infusions.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Health Benefits of Gut and Immune-Healing Products</h2><p>Whether you realize it or not, your gut microbiome and immune system are essential to your overall health. Schulick mentions that this knowledge played a key role when formulating his company’s supplements and infusions. “By helping gut health, we can improve immunity and mood, and by helping to soothe stress, we can support&nbsp;the gut and the immune system,” he says.</p><p>To achieve this goal, the company’s Gut-Lung Therapy capsules features&nbsp;a first-to-the-US probiotic strain called L. plantarum DR7. A 2020 study published in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">International Journal of Molecular Sciences</a> highlights the anti-inflammatory benefits of this probiotic strain, which may help support digestive&nbsp;health, diversify gut bacteria, and improve mood.</p><p>Schulick notes that the capsules also contain a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">postbiotic ingredient called fermentate</a>. Previous research <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">has linked</a> dried fermentate&nbsp;with decreasing inflammation throughout the body, especially in the immune system. “When it comes to immune health, we believe that&nbsp;constant, daily boosting may lead to imbalances,” he adds. “We prefer&nbsp;a ‘boost with balance’ approach for&nbsp;steady, long-term immune strength — because your immune system works 24/7, not just during cold and flu season.”</p><p>For extra immune protection, Immune Therapy Cistus + Infusion comes in handy tea bags to steep a health-boosting brew. This infusion contains Cistus incanus, a <a href=#>Mediterranean Blue Zone</a> herb. Schulick mentions that immune-strengthening powers are thanks to its <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">unique and potent polyphenol profile</a>.</p><p>Need to ease anxiety and stress? The company’s Stress Therapy Infusion features a five gram dose of chamomile per serving. This ancient herb is rich in a natural compound known as apigenin, which <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">has been shown</a> to have calming effects that are necessary to promote relaxation. (Pick up <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Stress Therapy Infusion from Amazon, $26.96</a>)</p><p>If you’re looking to give your gut and immunity a helping hand, add herbal remedies to your daily routine. Visit their <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">website</a>, where you can find additional information on their amazing health-protecting supplements and infusions!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/For-the-Biome-press-image-1.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to Add Gut and Immune Health Remedies to Your Everyday Routine</h2><p>Although the company doesn’t tell consumers when to take its products due to varying health needs, Schulick prefers taking one Gut-Lung Therapy capsule with breakfast to kickstart gut health in the morning. During the afternoon, he suggests brewing an Immune Therapy&nbsp;infusion bag for an immune-supporting sip. The Stress Therapy Infusion is ideal to enjoy during the evening to relax into the night.</p><p>“Depending on the product, people might experience benefits anytime between the very first sip, to two hours, to seven days, and beyond with&nbsp;long-term benefits,” he says.</p><p>Following Schulick’s suggestions of when to take these kinds of products, I noticed significant improvements in my energy levels and digestion within about three days. Plus, the capsules and infusions had a deliciously balanced yet earthy taste. I’m really looking forward to continuing to maintain a healthy gut and immune system with these products.</p><p>According to Schulick, the company’s capsules are made without sugar, fillers, or harsh chemical solvents. Also, he adds that using ancient ingredients such as chamomile and Cistus incanus, which have long been considered safe to consume. <strong>Remember:</strong> It’s best to speak with your doctor before starting a new supplement or herbal remedy to ensure that it’s a good fit for your health regimen.</p><p>Adding the right foods to your diet is another way to keep gut and immune health in great shape. Fruits like <a href=#>apples and pears</a> are known to help ward off viruses. In addition, foods such as <a href=#>leafy greens, oats, and yogurt</a> are filled with fiber and probiotics that help fight constipation and digestive issues. A gut and immune-friendly diet alongside the right herbal remedy is a winning combo for staying healthy all year round!</p><p>This article was not sponsored by For the Biome.
