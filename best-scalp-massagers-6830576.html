But, amidst all the new products flooding the market, it’s hard to know which <strong>scalp massagers</strong> perform best.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">That’s where we come in: We extensively researched the category, finding <strong>28 of the top-rated scalp</strong> <strong>massagers </strong>out there, and enlisting a team of I<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>nStyle</a><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2> editors to test</a> every single one. As we massaged our heads, we evaluated the bristle firmness, grippiness of the handle, ability to get around our whole head, and of course, the amount of build-up it was able to loosen from our scalp. After poring over each <strong>editor's notes and feedback</strong>, we curated this list of our top 10 favorites.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-leonor-greyl-massaging-scalp-brush></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Leonor Greyl Massaging Scalp Brush</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Leonor Greyl Massaging Scalp Brush" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/gm2rWaqIz3F68x2x5gHgC0DyRHU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/leonor-greyl-massaging-scalp-brush-cd014ac6788f419883277e370cee5098.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This scalp brush earns top honors in our book for its soft and durable bristles, ability to aid in product penetration, and great price. Not only did each editor provide rave reviews, but our friends couldn’t get enough of it, either, and the scalp massager soon became a house party favorite.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s easy to use on both dry and wet hair and amazing at working up suds, but we loved it most for a moment of relaxation. Unlike some other scalp massagers on the market, it doesn’t tangle strands, and its handle helped us maintain a good grip, so this massager could do all the heavy lifting. We found this massager's performance simply impeccable, but keep in mind that using it on dyed hair could stain the bristles — a very minor downside.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Recycled plastic and silicone | <strong>Hair Type:</strong> All</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-maxsoft-hair-scalp-massager></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Maxsoft Hair Scalp Massager</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Maxsoft Hair Scalp Massager" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/m1IiOReFloGZs1kIZ7OazhuYdS8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/maxsoft-hair-scalp-massager-b1888763b71c4755bb570d54210950bd.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re looking to try a scalp massager for the first time, this Maxsoft one is a perfect option: Its affordable price point makes it an easy investment. I actually ordered one a few months ago after being convinced by lifestyle influencer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Amanda Stanton Fogel</a>, and it’s been a staple in my wash day routine ever since. I’m not the only person who loves it, though — InStyle editors noticed a major difference in their hair when using it, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">And it all starts with the bristles — they're the perfect level of firmness and the spacing between them is excellent, not too close but not too far, so we could avoid tangles while still getting a great scrub. We sometimes even used it as a comb when applying a conditioning <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>hair mask</a> and unsurprisingly, the mask absorbed better on the side we applied it with the massager. Along with hair masks, it can be used for enhanced shampoo lather, and the sturdy handle is easy to slide in between your pointer and middle fingers for excellent grip.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Plastic and silicone | <strong>Hair Type:</strong> All&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-mount-lai-jade-massaging-comb></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Mount Lai Jade Massaging Comb</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Mount Lai Jade Massaging Comb" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/i0z0gh9g7sMr-a8eA2F7NGjyZ_E=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/mount-lai-jade-massaging-comb-d8f713d1e9624e1a94ffb59c6b2e1020.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Credo</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This hand-crafted comb is made from luxurious jade — the stone of eternal youth and balance. When you use this, you’re also adding a little piece of art to your bathroom counter. Before putting it to the test, former InStyle Commerce Writer, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Caitlyn Martyn</a>, was nervous the product would be uncomfortable to drag across her scalp, “but it’s surprisingly the opposite,” she says. “It feels stimulating and relaxing, and really glides through hair without pulling or tugging.” Martyn also reports that her hair oils sunk in faster, and her scalp felt more exfoliated after incorporating the comb into her routine. “I let my boyfriend borrow it and he loved it so much that he got his own! It works well on anyone, no matter your gender or how long your hair is,” she adds.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Be mindful that this is a tool that should be handled with care as jade is fragile and prone to breaking.&nbsp; Martyn accidentally dropped hers and a piece snapped off — luckily it is still usable, but that’s not the case for everyone.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Jade | <strong>Hair Type:</strong> All</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-most-ergonomic-vegamour-gro-revitalizing-scalp-massager></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Most Ergonomic</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Vegamour Scalp Massager</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1400 data-sizes=750px alt="image of vegamour scalp massager on white background" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/K_RjQfP6YOmovh_LlpnqN3iW4Tk=/fit-in/1500x1400/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/s2613263-main-zoom-4b624a51203d4b5e9685df67739e047d.jpeg"> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We love the way this massager feels in our hands — its comfortable grip won’t slip in the shower or increase finger tension, letting all the focus rest on your zen-like moment of relaxation. And we appreciate that the pretty design looks nice in the shower.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Martyn tried the massager with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>shampoo and conditioner</a> and noticed an increased level of penetration with the latter. However, she notes, “when I used it with shampoo, I didn’t feel that same level of absorption.” If you use <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>hair serums</a> or oils, it performs especially well on both wet and dry hair. “The bristles are a great balance of being firm yet pliable.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Plastic and silicone | <strong>Hair Type:</strong> All</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-exfoliation-jupiter-scalp-brush></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Exfoliation</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Jupiter Scalp Brush</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Jupiter Scalp Brush" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/32tuWHdINGKca5aEm4omv82aer0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/jupiter-scalp-brush-c66c074cd2484da2a58e5abd6e764304.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Jupiter</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With its firmer bristles and durable design, this brush is intended to cleanse the scalp of impurities, remove build-up, and gently exfoliate. It's lightweight and features a comfortable hole to slide your fingers through. For an added bonus, it comes with a clasped chain for easy hanging in your shower.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though the bristles are stronger than other tools we tried, they’re tightly packed together, meaning that we needed to apply more pressure to really get down to our roots and pull it through our thicker hair. When we used more gentle pressure, the bristles would only run through our top layer of our hair, and even that felt too light to be effective. Furthermore, we love the way the matte black handle and white bristles give the product a sophisticated design appeal.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Plastic and rubber | <strong>Hair Type:</strong> All</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-thick-hair-flathead-products-scalp-massager></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Thick Hair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Flathead Products Scalp Massager</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Flathead Products Scalp Massager" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/OM1k3PIKqHc706Ec53tF2xq5N0g=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/flathead-products-scalp-massager-5b8d48a692bb4d279998c0b7bb6dc31c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We love how simple it is to switch out these different massage inserts — just twist off the head of the massager, switch the insert, and then twist it back on. For thick hair, we recommend the longer bristle attachment, as it easily penetrates the hair to reach the scalp. On the flip side, the smaller stub insert is great for short, thinner hair, particularly when used with a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>scalp scrub</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Although we love our super thick hair, it can sometimes be tricky to get the shampoo suds all the way down to our scalp, but this massager helped us not only reach our scalp, but give it a thorough cleanse. The best part? It was only a fraction of the work it would have been if we used our fingers. Especially for the low price point, we’re impressed with the quality and how well it holds up after repeated use.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Plastic and silicone | <strong>Hair Type:</strong> All</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-thin-hair-briogeo-scalp-revival-stimulating-therapy-massager></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Thin Hair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Briogeo Scalp Revival Therapy Massager</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Briogeo Scalp Revival Stimulating Therapy Massager" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/R6EnyhUZ8O4R_igmyVg23NR-Zp0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/briogeo-scalp-revival-therapy-massager-2683914acc1049d2ada5a0e793425e7b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Another option that comes with an attached string for easy shower display, we love this Briogeo massager that gets to all the greasy build-up on our scalps. As a brand, Briogeo specializes in clean products that work for all different hair types — and this therapeutic tool is no different. “I frequently use <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>dry shampoo</a> which can build up on the scalp, and this brush does a better job of removing the residue than just my fingers,” explains former InStyle Assistant Commerce Editor, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Emily Cieslak</a>. “Just using it reminds me to take the time to massage my scalp in the shower.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though it’s hard to tell if using the massager actually contributes to new hair growth (a supposed benefit), Cieslak notes that it does make her shampoo and hair oil absorb more evenly and easily. Another plus?

Its bristles are definitely stiffer and more firm than other options we tested (they’re plastic as opposed to the softer silicone materials), but we thought they were perfect for a super deep clean.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We found the best way to handle the massager was by sliding three fingers inside the top loop, then massaging whatever product we were using onto our scalp and down through the ends. While we loved the lather it worked up when we used it with shampoo, it did its best work with our hair oil applications — we were able to target our applications with precision so we weren't wasting as much product, and the firm bristles really helped the oil penetrate deeply into our scalp, resulting in hair that feels healthier and looks shinier.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Plastic | <strong>Hair Type:</strong> Curly</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-absorption-comfier-cordless-hair-scalp-massager></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Absorption</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Comfier Cordless Hair Scalp Massager</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Comfier Cordless Hair Scalp Massager" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/CnE_V7Cd07quXUfMGyW5LypWHos=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/comfier-cordless-hair-scalp-massager--electric-head-be0f29a82a1f4dc18acf74a7f440ef33.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though this massager is far heavier than others we tried, its ergonomic design feels good in the hands, and its heftiness contributes to its high quality appeal. For an electric device, Cieslak says it’s surprisingly quiet. “The bristles are sturdy, but the tips are soft, so it’s really pleasing when moving on the scalp,” she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We love that there are four different massage settings for varying preferences —&nbsp; from light to vigorous (and, it can technically be used on your neck, back, and calves as well). The device comes with a charging base and USB cable, and once fully charged, should last cordless for several hours. Plus, it’s waterproof and safe for in-shower use.

If you have a sensitive scalp or sensitive skin, err on the side of softer bristles, and try a silicone brush. If you have grease-prone hair or are an avid dry shampoo user and require a bit more scrubbing to get all build-up off your scalp, opt for something more firm with plastic bristles.</li><li><strong>Your Hair Type</strong>: While most scalp massagers are safe and easy to use on all hair types, it is important to note that some are specifically designed for thick or curly hair and others perform better on thin hair. A good rule of thumb to follow is the thicker your hair, the larger the bristles need to be to reach your scalp. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Dry scalp</a> would also benefit from a massage tool to prevent flakes. &nbsp;<br></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered&nbsp;</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you use a scalp massager?&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“I encourage incorporating scalp massagers into the pre-shampoo treatment step, preferably using oil or serum products as the lubricant and exfoliant,” explains certified trichologist, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Bridgette Hill</a>. She notes that when used with a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>scalp treatment product</a> (in the pre-shampoo step of your routine), scalp massagers assist the active ingredients to penetrate deeper into the skin.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Hill advises to start by applying your pre-shampoo mask, oil, or treatment to your hair, then section the hair into quadrants, and twist the ends together, ensuring each is liberally coated. “Starting at the nape, use the scalp brush and make semicircle motions moving up and around the head,” she explains. “Next, apply shampoo over the pre-shampoo treatment before adding water to emulsify and rinse.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How often should you use a scalp massager?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“The most important consideration when deciding to try any scalp tool is that medically diagnosed scalp conditions should only incorporate scalp brushes under the guidance and supervision of a certified trichologist, MD, or dermatologist specializing in scalp and hair,” explains Hill. Otherwise, for non-medical scalp conditions or just standard self-care, scalp massagers can easily be incorporated into your weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly routine.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Does massaging your scalp help hair grow?&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">That’s a complicated question. Directly? No, they don’t. But, indirectly, they contribute to health benefits that, taken alongside other steps, can lead to hair growth. “Scalp massage improves blood circulation in the head and neck area,” explains Hill. “Research shows that scalp massage can lower blood pressure, reduce levels of stress hormones, slow heart rate, prevent flakes and dry scalp&nbsp;without the use of harsh chemical shampoos,” she adds.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“We know stress tightens the scalp and impedes circulation and hair growth. Depending on your hair care regimen and scalp condition, weekly scalp massages with massagers are excellent for overall health and well being. In a nutshell, scalp massagers and brushes aid with reducing tight muscles that are located in the scalp, in addition to improving circulation to deliver the necessary nutrients to the hair follicle for optimal hair growth,” adds Hill.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Linne Halpern</a> is a freelance beauty, fashion, and lifestyle writer.
