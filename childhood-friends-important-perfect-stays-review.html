I think they felt the same, as out of the blue we decided to spend Easter weekend together – baby, dog and partners in tow.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/dc7c7ce32b0f-gettyimages-1441668341.jpg><p id=eBP_zHdU8Y data-wc=70>Anyone who has been on trips with friends in adulthood will know planning it is not easy. First off, there's finding a weekend you can all make work. Then there's choosing a destination that suits everyone's location and budget, and then there's planning activities that appeal to new parents, child-free attendees and couples with dogs. It's no wonder weekends away in our thirties and beyond are far and few between.</p><p id=edtu4W86N8 data-wc=39>To make the whole experience as pain-free as possible – and actually relaxing, given it's a holiday after all - we booked our Easter trip through <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">Perfect Stays</a>, who offer incredible homes from home in Cornwall, Devon and Somerset.</p><p id=eMebuc7YTqe data-wc=51>Not just amazing properties, with coastal retreats and woodland cottages, Perfect Stays also offers a concierge service to book all your local activities, meaning you can truly relax and properly catch up with your old friends - read on for our thoughts on our Perfect Stays experience (Spoiler: it was amazing!)</p><p id=eidqlElyPJ data-wc=40>But first, I wanted to write about how glad I am we made the effort to book a weekend away, because spending time with our childhood friends when the playground is a distant memory is actually very good for us.</p><p id=ehNrpWRewAj data-wc=36>"There are lots of reasons why childhood friendships might be difficult to maintain: geography being an obvious one - however if we can stay in contact there are many benefits," confirms BACP registered therapist <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Susie Masterson</a>.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Why is making friends as an adult so hard?" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/3551664b5ce5-adult-friends.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Why is making friends as an adult so hard?" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Why is making friends as an adult so hard?</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><h2><strong>Why are childhood friends so important?</strong></h2><h3><strong>1. They chart our lives</strong></h3><p id=eP28ws5dYSGY data-wc=40>"Maintained childhood friendships are unique in that they chart both the highs and the lows of our lives," says Susie. "Though family relationships can be close, they can often be too close for us to feel really seen as adults."</p><p id=eX9_MQbGjmHU data-wc=25>"Friendships that endure from childhood offer us continuity, comfort and shared memories that stretch back years, if not decades," adds fellow <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">BACP</a>-registered therapist <strong>Madeleine Kingsley</strong>.</p><h3><strong>2. Nostalgia</strong></h3><p id=erNNP_AkUxC4 data-wc=37>"Spending time with childhood friends provides us with a space to reminisce about positive shared experiences," Susie continues.&nbsp;"We bonded over music, films, sporting achievements, makeup and so much more and we can revisit these shared memories."</p><p id=e-qhdlemxmwo data-wc=52>Madeleine agrees on the importance of shared history, noting: "Old friends are as deeply invested in their shared past as in each other’s futures. New friends are more like newspaper headlines- you know their story in brief, but you can never fully comprehend the context or complexity of their growing up years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/20b632f92ccc-adults-laughing.jpg><p id=ep6j5GLTI5iM data-wc=50>"You can’t conjure up the smell of her mum’s baking brownies, the tears shed over her first bad boyfriend, or the trouble she caused humming through German lessons. You won’t have exchanged crop tops, revision notes or first crush confidences – all those emotive hopes and anxieties of emotive adolescence."</p><h3><strong>3. Reconnecting with ourselves</strong></h3><p id=e93ZJFeCY4Ka data-wc=36>"When we connect with childhood friends, we are essentially reconnecting with and reclaiming ourselves," Susie says. "To be known by someone throughout different stages of our lives affirms our identity.&nbsp;It tells us that we matter."</p><p id=eaMMcNohZVEm data-wc=35>Another BACP-registered therapist <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">Charlotte Fox Weber</a> agrees, adding: "An old friend can also bring out mischief. We need reminders of how to play and find humour, and reconnecting with a friend can be a tonic."</p><h3><strong>4. Another perspective</strong></h3><p id=evBcKMRDqKHr data-wc=45>"The shared memories with childhood friends can be meaningful, but so can the differences in perspectives," points out Charlotte. "Your friend might remember another side of something you went through and offer a contrasting viewpoint. Piecing together details can add insight and have nostalgic value.</p><h3><strong>5. We have a shorthand with old friends</strong></h3><p id=ej0VCbPsh-EE data-wc=49>"There’s a shorthand with someone you’ve known since you hung upside down on the garden gate that gives them a quick understanding of your tears and trials," says Madeline. "They’ll be the one you turn to for wise words and consolation when you’re grappling with partner or offspring angst.</p><p id=eHi80rmwmCpb data-wc=43>"Having the intimate measure of you, old friends can make pretty good therapists, though they are less likely to be impartial or to challenge you – the upside of that is that they will always - or almost always - have your back."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3551664b5ce5-adult-friends.jpg><h2>Perfect Stays review</h2><p id=eQ-XMwS-jqh4 data-wc=41>We stayed at<a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">&nbsp;Fair Skies in St Merryn in Cornwall</a> and not only was it the most beautiful, high spec home with a huge garden and hot tub, it was also the best equipped holiday home I have ever stayed in.</p><p id=eAh9Z-8A9Zoc data-wc=56>Normally when I want to make a meal for my friends during a weekend away, it sees me using all kinds of bizarre utensils to try and cobble together a feast, but Fair Skies had everything you could possibly need, from hand blenders to food processors, to endless types of wine glass and bowls for nibbles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4113c2ddef60-perfect-stays-fair-skies-kitchen-1.jpg><p id=enRVwLYoD4Wr data-wc=59>Holiday homes often come with three mismatched plates and the odd pasta bowl, but Fair Skies had stylish crockery just begging to be used for a dinner party, and one of my friends was especially delighted by the fact there were two dishwashers – very helpful in a house that sleeps up to ten people across four sumptuous bedrooms.</p><h3><strong>Your own space</strong></h3><p id=elwww6TVlqWQ data-wc=63>Anyone who has been on holiday with a big group will know sometimes you need time out, and rather than having to squirrel yourself away in your chosen bedroom, Fair Skies had two living rooms, as well as the open plan kitchen living room, so if you wanted a moment alone to read or watch TV, there was ample space for solo time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/03fa979fcde2-perfect-stays-fair-skies-snug.jpg><h3><strong>The concierge offering</strong></h3><p id=eSVsqPRmPFSY data-wc=24>The concierge is on hand for any bookings, offering insider knowledge and local expertise, so you don't have to rely on Trip Advisor reviews.</p><p id=ekkxsI3N9wLt data-wc=53>They can arrange for a private chef to swing by, or send a spa therapist over to deliver a massage, but we used the concierge to book a wine tasting, which saw local resident <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">Jess Nelson</a> come over last minute on Saturday evening, bringing a selection of English wines for us to try.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/972722f1f7f9-perfect-stays-fair-skies-kitchen-2.jpg><p id=eHPFpjwsfFmT data-wc=66>Jess was full of knowledge, we were full of wine, and it was the perfect way to spend an evening when the wind was howling outside. We had a luxury experience without leaving our lovely holiday home, and I can only imagine how amazing the wine tasting would be on the house's generous patio on a summer's evening, sipping Cornish wine as the sun goes down.</p><p id=eZChkd1ueU7h data-wc=55>At the end of our stay at Fair Skies, we were truly sad to be leaving – while you sometimes miss home comforts when you're away, every single thing was thought of by Perfect Stays, and I wish we could have stayed put in the house for another week – that's how dreamy it was.</p><p id=exqHfZmdzNYk data-wc=11><a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">Fair Skies</a><strong>, from £2,415 per week, with short breaks from £2,215.</strong></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
