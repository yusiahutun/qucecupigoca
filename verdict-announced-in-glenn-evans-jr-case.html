After a bench trial that started 10 days ago, Judge Daniel Dalton took the case under consideration. In a jury trial, the juror make the decisions; in a bench trial, the judge makes the decisions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2024/03/Glenn-Evans-Jr.-mug-shot.jpg><p>Dalton spoke about the party on the night of the shooting and said “the vibe was good.” He told the court that on the night of the incident, McNair had taken a 9 mm Glock from Evans’ vehicle.</p><p>Evans discovered the Glock was missing from his car but found his father’s loaded Glock in the glove box. Dalton said he watched video of the incident repeatedly and advanced the video frame by frame at times. He told the court that, according to the video, shots were fired 35 seconds after Evans entered the home where the party was being held.</p><p>Witnesses at the party told investigators that Evans had aimed a gun in McNeil’s general direction. Dalton said he believed McNair shot first, because the angle of the shot that hit Evans could not have been self-inflicted.</p><p>However, Dalton said, “Mr. Evans lost the high ground as soon as he walked in and pointed the gun at Mr. McNair.” The second and third shots came from Evans, he said. Several more shots rang out as McNair hit the door. Dalton said Evans continued shooting, even after McNair was on the ground.</p><p>Evans took his Glock back from McNair, the judge told the court, and placed it back in his glove box. He gave the other Glock to his father, the gun’s owner, Dalton said. During an interrogation, Evans said he was “trained” to continue shooting until an aggressor was incapacitated, according to Dalton.</p><p>“Mr. McNair is dead and Mr. Evans’ future took a dark turn,” Dalton said before he announced the verdict. Evans was found guilty of first-degree murder. Supporters for both sides were quiet as the verdict was read.</p><p>Evans’ sentencing is scheduled for May 17 in Rock Island County Court.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46lppyZnGK7psPSaK2eqpSesLV5wKelqK2emLKlecinZKCklaO7brHVmqWsZZqneqSt0p5m</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./527662-ict-eliud-owalo-unveils-gor-mahias-42-seater-bus-usb-charging-sockets-foldable-tvs.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>ICT CS Eliud Owalo Unveils Gor Mahia's New 42-Seater Bus with USB Charging Sockets, Foldable TVs</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./best-setting-powders.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>15 Best Setting Powders 2022</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amal-clooney-mob-wife-trend-cream-fur-coat.html>Amal Clooney Elevates the Mob Wife Trend in a Cream Fur Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./demolition-underway-at-washington-elementary-davenport.html>Demolition underway at Washington Elementary, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iowa-man-killed-in-head-on-crash.html>Iowa man killed in head-on crash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./style-edit-richard-milles-technically-ambitious-new-rm-30-01-automatic-luxury-watch-was-inspired.html>Style Edit: Richard Milles technically ambitious new RM 30-01 Automatic luxury watch was inspired</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./463481-what-happened-frankie-lons-life-story-death.html>What happened to Frankie Lons?
