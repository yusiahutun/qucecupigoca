Here is a collection of long, good morning messages to make her fall in love with you over and over.</p><ul><li>I just heard our love song on the radio, and it gave me goosebumps. I am really excited about this day because it started with the thought of you. I love you, and I hope you'll have a nice day, baby. I miss you so much.</li><li>I dreamt that we were married and lived in a big mansion with our kids. I pray that the dream comes true one day. Good day, my queen.</li><li>Good morning! I hope you wake up this morning with the same smile on your face that makes everything feel better.</li><li>Waking up and not having by my side is always torture.

I love you!</li><li>Hello darling, may you have the best of days. If something does not work out as you planned, be patient, the day will end soon, and we will meet again.</li><li>Sometimes I wish there was no alarm clock because that is the only device that wakes me up while I dream of you.</li><li>I am thankful for having another day to spend with you. I wish you love and happiness, my queen.</li><li>I was just texting to make sure that you're real. Having you doesn't seem real. You're the best thing that has ever happened to me, and I will be forever grateful for every second that you spend with me.</li><li>I hope that everything goes great for you today, my queen; see you at nightfall; I cannot wait to have you in my arms and love you even more.</li><li>I really hope you had a good sleep. Please wake up now because my mornings are incomplete without you. Good morning, my love!</li><li>Just like how a beautiful morning is incomplete without its orange hue, my morning coffee is incomplete without texting you.</li><li>It's so hard to start my day without you. Even my favourite coffee doesn't taste good if you didn't make it. I miss you so much, and I love you even more. Have a blessed day, and take care of yourself.</li><li>The sun is shining, birds are singing, everything is so beautiful, but all I think about is you. I wish I could touch you right now. I can't wait to see you, baby. Enjoy your day and wait for me.</li><li>You know the perfect way to wake up would be with your kisses, but since that is not possible right now, you should know how happy I am because of you. Have a great day.</li><li>Sharing a smile is the easiest way to get your day started right. So here is a smile for you so that you can have a day as wonderful as you are.</li><li>Attention!! Attention!! The sexiest woman in the world has just woken up. Please look into your mirror and tell her, "Good morning."</li><li>Wake up and welcome yet another wonderful morning in your life. I know today you'll be shining like a star, just like any other day.</li><li>How did my baby sleep? Please know that I fall deeper and deeper in love with you every morning when I wake up.</li><li>Not Facebook, not Twitter, not anything else makes my time better, but the thought of seeing you.
