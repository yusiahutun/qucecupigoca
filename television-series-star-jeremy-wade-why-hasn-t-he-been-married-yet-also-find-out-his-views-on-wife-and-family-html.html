To satisfy such interests, you must have followed Animal Planet to see some extreme adventures that you hope to someday experience for yourself. Then you may catch a glimpse of an appealing fish angler, Jeremy Wade.</p><p>Jeremy Wade is the host of the top-rating Animal Planet’s program, ‘River Monsters.' Through the program, Wade investigates some of the most mysterious, deadly and unsolved underwater attacks and catches the responsible finned culprit.</p><p>But what his fans especially the male fans don’t know is that besides catching gigantic aquatic life, the English man captures the eyes of women around the world.But find out which woman has captured his heart? <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-198 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Married Life and Wife? Or Girlfriend?</h2><p>People often think that Wade’s show is something viewed mostly by men when in reality 45% of the viewers are women. There must be something about the Blue Eyes, White hair and an English accent that intrigues the women.</p><p>Maybe it’s the comforting personality of Wade that you see on the show. Whatever be the cause there are many reasons that have lead us to believe Wade is a sex-icon among women, the funniest one being the existence of Facebook pages like ‘Jeremy Wade is Sexy’ and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">‘Jeremy Wade Shirtless.</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>My family hate that I love <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">#RiverMonsters</a> and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">@JeremyWade_RM</a> so much — Deborah Holt (@deborahholt3) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">May 17, 2016</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>River Monsters in HD ????

Wade’s brother, Martin in a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">lengthy phone interview</a> disclosed information to the media that made the situation clearer.</p><h2>Why Still Single?</h2><p>According to him, Wade may be great in many things, but the relationship isn’t one of them. He already has a hard time balancing his existing relationship with his family that he will not risk making new ones.</p><p>You see since Wade was introduced to fishing as a child back home <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">in the banks of Suffolk River</a>. He had demonstrated great interest and talent in the field and after his first quest to India in 1982 started his unquenchable thirst for fishing.</p><p>Since then Wade has devoted 25 years of his life to catch monsters that roam just beneath the surface. So the topper most priority in Wade’s life in Fishing whereas for others it's family. Marriage is the final thing in the mind of Wade. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-600 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>Caption: A young Jeremy Wade holding a fish of substantial size</strong></p><p>Source: Youtube channel of Animal Planet</p><p>But this does not mean that Jeremy Wade is a bum. A determined, hardworking and a down-to-the-earth person like himself should be a perfect candidate for a life partner. However, he invests these qualities towards his adventures to the deepest and uncharted regions of the world in search for the most mysterious fishes. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-601 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span><p>Jeremy Wade is not at fault as in the past he had once tried to settle down, got a job only to quit it weeks later after the very girl he attempted it for broke his heart calling him a “Waster.”</p><p>You can say that he is a hard fish to tie down. Jeremy lives a highly non-materialistic life as you might know seeing him in plain and sometimes torn clothes. He also believes that even if he finds someone willing to accept him for all he is then he could unknowingly ruin that person’s life as his line of work puts him in life-death situations.</p><h2>His Views:</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-602 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>“It’s all about being accepted for who I am,” he says. “That goes for anybody, doesn’t it? To be accepted for who you are.” He further adds, “I’d prefer to be in some remote part of the world with not much in my pockets and not know what I’m going to be doing the next day.”</p><p><strong>Caption: The life of Jeremy Wade</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, ‘the star anchor of Animal Planet’s number one show’ maybe a lot of things but a husband and father is not one of them. He is not looking to get married and have wife or kids o r even thinking about a love relationship, and the possibility of him wanting to start a family isn’t there for the near future as well. The evergreen Jeremy Wade is a fish who shall remain the one that got away for his female admirers.</p><p dir=ltr lang=es>Y estoy muy feliz de conocer a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">@JeremyWade_RM</a> .

Well, he is open to eating all sorts of water creatures. He revealed to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">'page six' on April 2016</a> that he gradually comes to eating fishes even on his trips.</p><p>Being an expert in fishing&nbsp;is sort of like a portable heating source for him, so he gradually fishes for his belly.As for something like piranhas, they don't particularly taste that good, but it's nice to sometimes exchange the roles, he thinks. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-603 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">AMA</a>&nbsp;(ask me anything) session on April 2016, he was asked if he ever ate the fishes he caught to which he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">answered</a>,</p><p>I sometimes eat small fish that I catch if there's plenty of them in the river. I've eaten piranhna, but they're not very good. I do it more for the role reversal. My favorite is a tambaqui, a relative of the pacu. The tambaqui has teeth a bit like a horse's teeth used for crushing nuts. When the river floods, they hang out under trees that are dropping nuts, so they have a very rich, organic diet. Their meat is delicious.</p><h2>Jeremy Wade and crew saves Stranded man:</h2><p>It was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> on April 2016 that the crew of 'River Monsters' had rescued a stranded man on the Barranyi North Island of Australia while searching for the 'giant groper' fish. Apparently, the man had been lost while digging for oysters and was extremely dehydrated when Wade and his team found him. That's another life saved by the hardcore fisherman.</p><h2>Jeremy Wade's Short-Bio:</h2><p>Jeremy John Wade was born in Ipswich on March 23, 1956. He attended Dean Close School and graduated from Bristol University with a degree in Zoology. He has also received a&nbsp;postgraduate teaching certificate from the&nbsp;University of Kent&nbsp;in the field of biological sciences and previously worked as&nbsp;a secondary school biology teacher. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-604 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Wade started his journey of traveling around the world to find exotic fishes by going to India to catch the Himalayan Mahseer. This experience led him to find more places to visit and more fishes to hunt.</p><p>The concept of 'River Monsters' came to him when he visited the Himalayan Foothills where locals had been disappearing when they went to the River and the people believed the perpetrator to be a fish. The fish was revealed to be&nbsp;a 161-pound&nbsp;Goonch catfish. Taking this mysterious nature as the basis, Wade came up with the idea of 'River Monsters.' The pilot episode of 'River Monsters' aired on 5th May 2010.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-655></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZq2dnJrDqr%2FIqKVmq5Wntqa%2FjKyrmqpdn7KzscyyZLCZlJp6uLTYZp%2Baq55iwW60xGaZnp2eYrqivtGinJ1lqZrBbq3LrKZmnpmjsW671K1koaGjYsOqsdasZKimXay2p7GMmqWdZZaWuqq42GefraWc</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tennis-legends-steffi-graf-andre-agassi-cheer-son-usc-baseball-game-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tennis legends Steffi Graf and Andre Agassi cheer on their son at his first USC baseball game</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./nik-kacy-had-nowhere-buy-gender-neutral-shoes-so-they.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>NiK Kacy had nowhere to buy gender-neutral shoes so they founded their own footwear brand that th</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amal-clooney-mob-wife-trend-cream-fur-coat.html>Amal Clooney Elevates the Mob Wife Trend in a Cream Fur Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./demolition-underway-at-washington-elementary-davenport.html>Demolition underway at Washington Elementary, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iowa-man-killed-in-head-on-crash.html>Iowa man killed in head-on crash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./style-edit-richard-milles-technically-ambitious-new-rm-30-01-automatic-luxury-watch-was-inspired.html>Style Edit: Richard Milles technically ambitious new RM 30-01 Automatic luxury watch was inspired</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./463481-what-happened-frankie-lons-life-story-death.html>What happened to Frankie Lons?
