Although the <a href=#>Kelly Clarkson Show</a> star and the music executive <a href=#>called it quits</a> following nearly seven years of marriage with their divorce finalized in March 2022, the former couple is focusing on doing what’s best for their blended brood.</p><p>“<a href=#>Kelly and Brandon’s priority is their kids</a>. They’re on board about moving forward with coparenting as their prime concern,” an insider exclusively told Closer after she filed for divorce in early June 2020, citing “irreconcilable differences” as the reason for their split.</p><p>The “Since U Been Gone” singer and Brandon share their <a href=#>two kids, River Rose and Remington</a>, while the talent manager is also the dad of his eldest children, Savannah and Seth, from his previous marriage to <strong>Melissa Ashworth</strong>. “They’re working on making this transition as easy as possible for all their kids,” the source explained of the former couple, who tied the knot in 2013. “She considers his kids hers … so, it’s going to be an emotionally tough road ahead.”</p><p>In late November 2020, the <a href=#>American Idol</a> alum was granted primary physical custody of their little ones. According to documents obtained by Closer, the “Stronger” songstress was given primary custody of their daughter, River, and their son, Remington, due to an “increased” level of conflict.</p><p>“The court finds that under the circumstances present in this case, the interest in providing stability and continuity for the minor children weighs in favor of Petitioner having primary custody,” the court document read. “The parties have a difficult time coparenting due to issues of trust between them.”</p><p>In the former couples’ divorce settlement, Kelly and Brandon agreed to joint legal custody of the kids, with the talk show host having primary physical custody in Los Angeles. River and Remington will visit Brandon one weekend per month at the Montana ranch he’s been staying at since the pair’s split. Kelly made a one-time payment of $50,000to Brandon for the children’s private air travel costs, and Brandon in return agreed to pay Kelly $52,000 per month in rent to stay at the ranch, which he must vacate by June 1, 2022. Kelly must also pay Brandon $45,601 in child support a month for their children.</p><p>It’s been nearly two years since Kelly and Brandon called it quits, but fans are still shocked considering the “Because of You” songstress seemed so smitten about her longtime love. In fact, the duo’s romance kicked off with a whirlwind start as they got engaged just 10 months after they began dating in 2012.</p><p>The “My Life Would Suck Without You” singer sweetly opened up about her relationship with the music guru at the time. “I’ve never been truly loved like I am right now,” she gushed to <a href=#>Cosmopolitan</a> in January 2013.</p><p>Even before welcoming River Rose and Remington together, Kelly marveled over becoming the proud stepmom to Brandon’s kids. “We all live together and everything. It’s so different, but it’s perfect. They’re awesome, and I actually really dig the mom thing,” Kelly revealed on “On Air With Ryan Seacrest” in 2013.</p><p><strong>Scroll through the gallery below to learn more about Kelly and Brandon’s children.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46knKWkqWKwra3RpKqopl2gtqW%2FjKygp5%2BVp3qiusNmmauZnpm8r3nBpZico6OpvKS3jKyfmqqVYoFur8eio52qlaN8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kristen-soltis-anderson.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kristen Soltis Anderson Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./karla-mora-and-guillermo-ochoa.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Karla Mora and Guillermo Ochoa</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amal-clooney-mob-wife-trend-cream-fur-coat.html>Amal Clooney Elevates the Mob Wife Trend in a Cream Fur Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./demolition-underway-at-washington-elementary-davenport.html>Demolition underway at Washington Elementary, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iowa-man-killed-in-head-on-crash.html>Iowa man killed in head-on crash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./style-edit-richard-milles-technically-ambitious-new-rm-30-01-automatic-luxury-watch-was-inspired.html>Style Edit: Richard Milles technically ambitious new RM 30-01 Automatic luxury watch was inspired</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./463481-what-happened-frankie-lons-life-story-death.html>What happened to Frankie Lons?
