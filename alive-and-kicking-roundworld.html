"There's a lot of science in it, and as Slartibartfast [in ] said: 'I am a great fan of science, but I cannot do a quadratic equation.' I've never, ever been able to do one. I remember one occasion at Warwick University, when Jack and Ian were at their wits' end because I couldn't get it. I felt totally ashamed."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">So as well as writing the sections, Pratchett also becomes the everyman figure wrestling with difficult scientific propositions. Is he a frustrated scientist? "I was a very keen reader of science fiction," he says, "and during the time I was going to libraries, it was good, written by people who knew their science."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">ZBy the time he was in his teens, Pratchett was writing science fiction and attending conventions. "The first convention I ever went to, I met Arthur C. Clarke, Mike Moorcock, John Brunner, and just about everyone who was around. This was like going to see the immortals, and you suddenly realised that they're science-fiction writers and they're human beings and you are a human being, so there's no reason why you couldn't be a science-fiction writer."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Pratchett was an only child in a working-class family in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, southern England. Born in 1948, he grew up in the fevered 1960s, when the beginnings of space travel coincided with a golden age in science fiction. "My mum was fairly pushy, before pushiness was in vogue, and it was her who got me writing." She was of Irish heritage and loved telling stories - a gift she passed on to her son. He says his life can be summed up as: "Terry Pratchett, from birth to death a writer."</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">It's hard to read a lot of science fiction and be a bigotTerry Pratchett</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Despite his mother's pushiness, he underperformed at school. "I couldn't get on with the headmaster, and he couldn't get on with me."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He is thankful, however, that he fell out with the head. It made him leave school at 17 to become a journalist on the , the perfect apprenticeship for a would-be writer. "Local journalism is journalism," he says. "If you get it wrong, they know where you live. You see more things and do more things than you would ever see or do on a mainstream newspaper. I saw my first dead body on my first day at work."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He moved from local journalism to a PR job with the Central Electricity Generating Board, but never stopped writing and reading; he is an autodidact who devours everything that comes his way, and says he has three libraries at home. "If the government ever imposes a tax on books - and I wouldn't put it past them - I'm in dead trouble."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">His early novels did reasonably well, but his breakthrough came in the mid-1980s with ; this year marks the 30th anniversary of the first of the series, . Much to his relief, he was able to give up the day job and concentrate on writing.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">How did he hit on the idea? "It just happened," he says. "It started off as making fun of fantasy fiction. But when sold out in hardcover on the first day, I thought I'll do another one."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The books got better as the series progressed: his satire of fantasy books became a satire of the world at large. He extended his targets "to stop myself being a man who shouts at the television".</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Pratchett still loves attending conventions, and meeting his new generation of readers. He also likes the fact he has readers of all ages. "Fantasy is uni-age. You can start it in the creche, and it follows you to death."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">What unites readers? "They are serendipitists," says Pratchett, "pickers-up of interesting things you hadn't expected to see. That applies to most science-fiction buffs." He says they are also open-minded, and that it wasn't an accident the first interracial kiss on TV happened on . "It fits into what science fiction is, which is people being people and not worrying about what shape, size or colour you are. It's hard to read a lot of science fiction and be a bigot."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Pratchett refuses to be bowed down by his illness, and is producing as much as ever, though these days he finds it hard to type: he dictates into a computer and then edits the text.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There have been suggestions that at some point his daughter, Rhianna, who writes stories for video games, could take over the series. "It will be entirely up to her," says Pratchett. "She's doing very well by herself."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He is also looking to the survival of his creation on film and, with Rhianna, set up a production company, Narrativia, to rectify the absence of movies. "There's always Hollywood interest, but Hollywood is full to the brim with people who have the ability to say no and only about one person who can say yes," he says. "You could die waiting for Hollywood."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Pratchett is protective of the sort of film that might get made: he says he has twice pulled out of deals. "If is made, it has to be mine, not theirs. It's all about the money in Hollywood, but how much money does one person need when what I really want is for it to be done properly? It will happen - one day. And with Narrativia protecting my creative interests, I know it will be faithful to my words."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Despite all this talk of protecting the legacy, Pratchett isn't planning on going anywhere just yet. "They'll have to kill me before I go," he says, laughing. But when his time does come, he will accept it as stoically as his parents, who always insisted on treating death as a fact of life, and not as a taboo. "It's not morbid to talk about death," he insists. "Most people don't worry about death, they worry about a bad death."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Pratchett supports assisted dying, so that the terminally ill can be given the sort of easeful death his parents wanted. "Death is the commonality of mankind," he says. "Everybody dies. Make it as good as you can while you're doing it, but don't worry about it happening - because you can't ultimately do anything about it."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In , Death is an attractive, sympathetic, sometimes comic figure, a far-from-grim reaper - and Pratchett sees no reason to change his view in Roundworld.</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Disc world of a difference</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZK%2Bwu8qsZpqqpJ6wrbGOamlra2duf3Cty6KtnmWRo7Fut8icoqKml2K%2FsMHNna6oqpyZ</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./amber-davies-christmas-jumper-swimsuit.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Amber Davies shows off her stunning figure in Christmas jumper-themed swimsuit</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./best-advent-calendars-for-kids.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>45 Best kids advent calendars in 2023: Disney, toys, chocolate and more</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amal-clooney-mob-wife-trend-cream-fur-coat.html>Amal Clooney Elevates the Mob Wife Trend in a Cream Fur Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./demolition-underway-at-washington-elementary-davenport.html>Demolition underway at Washington Elementary, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iowa-man-killed-in-head-on-crash.html>Iowa man killed in head-on crash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./style-edit-richard-milles-technically-ambitious-new-rm-30-01-automatic-luxury-watch-was-inspired.html>Style Edit: Richard Milles technically ambitious new RM 30-01 Automatic luxury watch was inspired</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./463481-what-happened-frankie-lons-life-story-death.html>What happened to Frankie Lons?
