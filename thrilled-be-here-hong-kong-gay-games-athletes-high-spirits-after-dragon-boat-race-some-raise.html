Organisers said the eight-hour event was the most popular among participants so far.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Organisers said about 11 of the 44 teams competing were from overseas, 17 were from city-based companies, another two were composed of individual sign-ups and the remainder comprised local dragon boat groups.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A Post reporter observed that the spectator turnout was low and largely consisted of the contestants’ friends and family, or residents who happened to stop by the river.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Police also deployed about 10 officers in two vans to a nearby car park, while venue security was handled by a private company.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">No signs were put up around the surrounding area to promote the Games.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lawyer Niall Daws, 39, who travelled from London with his Thames Dragons teammates, said the group was enjoying the Games.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s been great fun,” he said. “There are plenty of teams, which is always good and some really strong competition.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He also described opposition to the event on national security grounds as “laughable”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On November 1, seven anti-LGBTQ lawmakers called for the Games to be cancelled, claiming the event subverted traditional Chinese values and posed a national security risk.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">David Ko, the Games’ director of marketing and public relations, hit back at the legislators during the launch ceremony on Saturday and stressed the event aimed to strengthen inclusion.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The Gay Games are a non-political sports, art and culture event that aims to promote diversity and inclusion,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Mr [Junius] Ho trying to draw a connection to the [national security law] is irrelevant, ridiculous and risks making Hong Kong an international laughing stock.”</p><h3 type=h3

data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Some competitors expressed concerns over the level of organisation before events, including a Hong Kong freelance designer who gave his name as Jack and said he would enter the 5km open water swimming race at the Victoria Recreation Club in Deep Water Bay next Saturday.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I received a lot of information about the opening ceremony, gala concerts and after-party, but no route map or information on the number of buoys, yet,” the 34-year-old said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Jack added that he had taken part in a similar event in Discovery Bay at the end of September and received a route map months in advance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Other athletes also cited a lack of refreshments at sporting events and said they were told to bring their own, despite some paying a HK$1,500 (US$191) registration fee and another HK$800 to compete.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“[Gay Games Hong Kong organisers] made it clear that there is no food or drinks at the racetrack [or other events],” said Ricky, a Hongkonger who travelled from Canada with his partner for the marathon at Pak Tam Chung next Saturday.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I have never heard of a marathon that does not have refuelling stations. This is very different to the Paris Games in 2018.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The route map showed four water stations, but Ricky and several other contestants said they believed the spots were public drinking fountains.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A Games spokesman said some event venues did not have licences to offer food and drinks, adding the policy was also a way of reducing waste.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He also attributed the poor communication between organisers and athletes to a “system error”.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Regina Ip says she has never backed same-sex marriage amid Hong Kong Gay Games row</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“People would register through the system, and we kept the enrolment open for longer because of Covid-19 and to get more participants, so there is more data which could lead to a system error,” the spokesman said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Some competitors might have missed out on contest information because they had input their data incorrectly, he added.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">About 2,400 participants from 45 locations are competing in the Hong Kong leg of the Games, which consists of 18 events and wraps up next Saturday. A further 2,400 people are competing in events organised by Games’ co-host Guadalajara city in Mexico.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hong Kong is the first Asian city to host the Games since the event was established in 1982.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0mifqKaXYriwusZoqqibmZrBunvAq6uim5yafHR%2Bk2lra2lfqbWztculnJ1lkpp6qbHRnmShp56ceqy7zaBkoJmpYrSiucSsZJqsmKGytbHSZp%2Bin5hiwLG10aKrrGWRm8GmvoydqZqfn6N6o7vArWSrmZOaerS7zJ5kq5mZqLI%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./will-smith-daughter-willow-smith-makes-big-change-appearance-new-hairstyle.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Will Smith's daughter Willow Smith makes big change to appearance with chic new hairstyle - sparks r</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sql-commands-cheat-sheet.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Essential SQL Commands Cheat Sheet for Beginners</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amal-clooney-mob-wife-trend-cream-fur-coat.html>Amal Clooney Elevates the Mob Wife Trend in a Cream Fur Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./demolition-underway-at-washington-elementary-davenport.html>Demolition underway at Washington Elementary, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iowa-man-killed-in-head-on-crash.html>Iowa man killed in head-on crash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./style-edit-richard-milles-technically-ambitious-new-rm-30-01-automatic-luxury-watch-was-inspired.html>Style Edit: Richard Milles technically ambitious new RM 30-01 Automatic luxury watch was inspired</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./463481-what-happened-frankie-lons-life-story-death.html>What happened to Frankie Lons?
