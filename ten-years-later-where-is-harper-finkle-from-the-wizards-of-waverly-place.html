After the series ended, Stone found a new purpose and career path, quite distinct from the entertainment industry.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>If she did not grab attention for her wise ways in dealing with her TV best friend, Alex Russo, Harper Finkle stole many hearts for her eccentric fashion “The Wizards of Waverly Place.” The role was popularized by star actress Jennifer Stone, and she maintained it until the Disney series ended in 2012.&nbsp;</p><p>Playing Finkle on the teen show was Stone’s most famous role, and after that, she decided on a different career path. Here’s the surprising field Stone now cherishes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/harper-finkle.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=stone-s-life-after-the-wizards-of-waverly-place><span class=ez-toc-section id=Stones_Life_After_%E2%80%9CThe_Wizards_Of_Waverly_Place%E2%80%9C></span><strong>Stone’s Life After “The Wizards Of Waverly Place</strong>“<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>David Henrie, Maria Canals-Barrera, Selena Gomez, Jake T Austin, David DeLouise, and Jennifer Stone all&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">bade farewell to the beloved show in 2012,&nbsp;</a>opening doors for more opportunities.&nbsp;</p><p>Like her fellow cast members, Stone moved on with her acting career, starring in a few film projects like Nickelodeon’s “Deadtime Stories and Nasty Habits.” But, after a while, Stone decided it was time for college. Once speaking about her decision to go to college, Stone&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">shared</a>:</p><p>“I’d been acting since I was six, so I took a break to go to school to just make sure that this is what I wanted to do and to just explore other options.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/1bea03658d683df89fae302c1134bb0a.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=the-tv-star-chose-a-career-in-healthcare><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_TV_Star_Chose_A_Career_In_Healthcare></span><strong>The TV Star Chose A Career In Healthcare</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Stone chose to major in Psychology at Glendale Community college. However just before she started her education, the former child star&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes</a>. Stone had a change of heart at this point and opted for nursing.&nbsp;</p><p>The star once shared her motivation for choosing nursing with Beyond Type 1, a non-profit focused on providing resources for diabetic patients. Stone&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">noted</a>:</p><p>“More than learning the semantics of beta-cells and autoimmune disorders, I wanted to understand my body and the impact of Type 1.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Disney-finkle.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jennifer_Stone_Is_A_Nursing_Graduate></span>Jennifer Stone Is A Nursing Graduate <span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In April 2020, Stone took to her Instagram page celebrating her big academic win. In addition, the actress let her fans know that she became a nursing graduate and was excited to contribute her quota to the medical world.</p><p>Stone shared a lovely boomerang clip of herself holding her certificate on what seemed to be the day of her graduation. She rocked a striped dress and completed her elegant look with a pair of heels and her school’s sash.&nbsp;</p><p>Stone’s graduation came amid the beginning of the <a href=#>pandemic</a>, and she wasted no time throwing her weight into joining other health workers on the frontline. She also stayed in touch with her followers on social media, sensitizing them of the need for a mask.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p><strong>How She Handles Acting and Nursing</strong></p><p>While Stone’s acting career took the backseat for the better part of her nursing education, her “The Wizard of Waverly Place” resume did come in handy a few times. Once on a summer break, the star appeared in 2019’s road trip movie, “In-Between.”</p><p>However, after graduation, the Harper Finkle star landed a job at Providence’s ER department. She has since been busy with her job of fighting the novel coronavirus.&nbsp;</p><p>Once speaking with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadline</a>, the TV star shared that the health care facility was preparing for another surge. She also talked about being in a new territory and navigating life as a new nurse.&nbsp;</p><p>Stone spoke about holding on to selflessness while working her 12-hour shift. She stated the reality of taking care of patients for long hours and being hit with the need to put yourself aside while seeing to the patient’s best interest.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Stone_Found_A_Suitable_Routine></span>Stone Found A Suitable Routine <span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The 27-year-old actress stated that she would often stay focused during her long hours so she could optimize productivity. However, the most rewarding part of it all was when she went home to decompress in a bubble bath.&nbsp;</p><p>Stone also enjoys relaxing moments by watching “Drag Race” and some medical shows. Over the years, the Disney star has learned to balance acting and nursing, although it requires time management.</p><p>Being a diabetic patient is also a factor in how Stone manages her time. She noted that she always had to make time to exercise and sleep adequately, but acting is not in the way because she has mastered the art of balancing time.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kwaa6jLKcmqqjYrmiwMSrZLCglaeybrXSZp%2BaqqCav26yyKeipZ1dm7%2BwuYytn55lp57Hor7DrGSonl2srrex0aWwZqiclrCmew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./best-movie-quotes.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Best Lines from Every Oscar Best Picture Winner</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./shaun-white-s-girlfriend-sarah-barthel-see-her-career-net-worth-and-dating-history.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Shaun White's Girlfriend Sarah Barthel, see her Career, Net Worth and Dating history</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amal-clooney-mob-wife-trend-cream-fur-coat.html>Amal Clooney Elevates the Mob Wife Trend in a Cream Fur Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./demolition-underway-at-washington-elementary-davenport.html>Demolition underway at Washington Elementary, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iowa-man-killed-in-head-on-crash.html>Iowa man killed in head-on crash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./style-edit-richard-milles-technically-ambitious-new-rm-30-01-automatic-luxury-watch-was-inspired.html>Style Edit: Richard Milles technically ambitious new RM 30-01 Automatic luxury watch was inspired</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./463481-what-happened-frankie-lons-life-story-death.html>What happened to Frankie Lons?
