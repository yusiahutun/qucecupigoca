She has been nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award and three NAACP Image Awards for her role in the television show. But, equally interesting is her love life. She has been quoted public declaring her virginity and her stand on dating. So, who is Yvonne Orji's boyfriend, and what do you know about her <a href=#>relationships</a>?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/be71b20a4c8e31ab.jpg><p class=align-left>Is Yvonne Orji in a relationship? Is she married? These are perhaps the common questions among the actress's fans and online followers. She is a strong subscriber to the Christian faith and has been frank about her affairs.</p><h2>Who is Yvonne Orji's boyfriend?</h2><p class=align-left>As at the moment, Yvonne Orji is single. However, she has been in a few <a href=#>relationships</a> before. She has dated Emmanuel Acho and Jay Ellis.</p><p class=align-left>Yvonne has a stringent rule when it comes to dating. One of the rules is that there is no s*ex before marriage, and she is pretty strict about it. It would, therefore, not surprise you that at 37, she is still a v*irgin.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7b25be3b6333adfd.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who are Halsey's parents?

This means that her parents have a different perspective towards dating, relationships and s*ex. Her parents instilled strong and <a href=#>Godly values</a> in her.</p><p class=align-left>The actress was sure she could date and even become sexually intimate with a man when she turns 18. Unfortunately, her expectations in a relationship were quite high, and her college dates did not seem promising. She decided to wait.</p><p class=align-left>As she grew older, she realised that she was waiting <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">for some characteristics</a> rather than blindly getting into a relationship.
