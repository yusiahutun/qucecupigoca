But what exactly do the two actors have in common? Let’s find out.</strong></p><p>Ryan Reynolds and Ryan Gosling are two of the most famous actors currently in Hollywood. They are bankable blockbuster movie stars, and their films, if calculated together, have grossed billions of dollars.</p><p>However, the pair differ in what they bring to their on-screen persona. While Reynolds dazzles fans with his comical performances and sense of humor,&nbsp;Gosling is more famous for his dramatic performances.</p><p>The actors have been taking over the screens for years, and both have become household names in the industry. Although they haven’t appeared in a film together, Reynolds and Gosling seem connected in other ways.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/05/89/9f/05899f15c601890ac5157a27abb26011.jpg><p>Since their fame, the actors have often drawn comparison conversations. Other times they even get confused for each other. In April, fans got to see new images of the upcoming movie “The Gray Man” starring Gosling.</p><p>The movie is one of Netflix’s most anticipated movies of 2022 and the most expensive ever made by the company, with a budget of $200 million. With a star-studded cast including Chris Evans, Ana de Armas, and Llyod Hansen, Gosling stars as Court Gentry, a skilled CIA mercenary.</p><p>However, while announcing and posting pictures of the movie, a news outlet News18.com mistakenly <a href=#>credited </a>Reynolds instead of Gosling. True to his comical persona, Reynolds jokingly accepts he had become a part of the cast rather than correct the mistake.</p><p>This type of mistaken identity between the two has become a regular occurrence and an ongoing joke in the industry.&nbsp; Following that tide, here are all the similitudes between the two.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Ryan_Reyolds_and_Ryan_Gosling_Were_Both_Born_in_Canada></span><strong>Ryan Reyolds and Ryan Gosling Were Both Born in Canada</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Yes! They are more famous in America than most native American actors. However, Reynolds and Gosling were born and<a href=#> raised</a> in Canada. The American transplants were birthed in Vancouver and London, Ontario, respectively.</p><p>On October 23, 1976, Reynolds was born, and the young boy was the youngest of four boys by his parents. Meanwhile, Gosling was born on November 12, 1980, four years younger than Reynolds.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Ryan_Reyolds_and_Ryan_Gosling_Started_Their_Careers_Acting_in_Canadian_TV_Shows></span><strong>Ryan Reyolds and Ryan Gosling Started Their Careers Acting in Canadian TV Shows.</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Reynolds and Gosling both developed an interest in acting at a young age, albeit through contrasting situations. Reynolds’ love for acting arose due to the solace he found in school productions because of his sensitivity and vulnerability as a young kid.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/736x/94/34/2f/94342f852ab420e7d8008aae809b13aa.jpg><p>Meanwhile, Gosling, who grew up in a working-class Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints family, became inspired after watching Sylvester Stallone’s action film “First Blood.”</p><p>Reynolds <a href=#>made </a>his Tv debut at the age of 12 when he got cast in the Canadian teen drama “Hillside” and later renamed “Fifteen” when it aired in America. The show went on for two years, from 1991 to 1993.</p><p>On the other hand, Gosling got his big break in 1993 when he joined the cast of “The Mickey Mouse Club,” a variety show for young kids. The youngster sang and danced with other future stars like Justin Timberlake, Christina Aguilera, and Britney Spears.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/be/b1/22/beb122725ceb51e6c4389c2e921229d5.jpg><p>“The Mickey Mouse Club” aired for two years before its cancellation in 1995. After that, Gosling starred in the teen comedy “Breaker High,” which ran from 1997 to 1998.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Ryan_Reyolds_and_Ryan_Gosling_Are_Both_Married_to_Hollywood_Actresses></span><strong>Ryan Reyolds and Ryan Gosling Are Both Married to Hollywood Actresses</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Like many celebrity colleagues, Reynolds and Gosling have had their share of Hollywood romance and heartbreaks. The former dated Canadian singer Alanis Morissette for several years and even got engaged in 2004. Sadly they broke it off in 2007.</p><p>That same year, Reynolds started dating actress Scarlett Johansson, and they got married in 2008. However, just two years later, the couple separated in December 2010. Nonetheless, Reynolds found love again with actress Blake Lively.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/cd/f3/c6/cdf3c6906cc8401105ba17d3cbe83ce2.jpg><p>Reynolds and Lively got <a href=#>married</a> on September 9, 2012, and have been together ever since. They’ve also become parents to three adorable kids.</p><p>Meanwhile, Gosling has also had romantic links to many beautiful actresses in the industry. In 2004 he was <a href=#>linked </a>to “X-Men” star Femke Janssen, although neither confirmed their relationship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/57/18/42/57184235ef0da8b5393dd0c3c46c8e71.jpg><p>Other rumored love interests include Jamie Murray, Casey LaBow, Kat Dennings, and Olivia Wilde. However, one true romance is that Gosling and Sandra Bullock used to be an item. They dated from March 2001 until December 2002 before going their separate ways.</p><p>In 2010 Gosling briefly dated Blake Lively, who is currently Reynolds’ wife. Just a year later, he and actress Eva Mendes co-starred in the movie “The Place Beyond the Pines” and started a romantic relationship during filming. They’ve since become parents to two beautiful kids.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Ryan_Reynolds_and_Ryan_Gosling_Have_Only_Daughters></span><strong>Ryan Reynolds and Ryan Gosling Have Only Daughters</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Reynolds and Gosling are fathers to five daughters altogether. The “Deadpool” star has three daughters to Gosling’s two. Reynolds welcomed his first daughter named James with his wife Lively in December 2014.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/45/7f/65/457f6582f229a491c75d97d3d5b649ad.jpg><p>The couple welcomed their second child, another daughter named Ines, on September 30, 2016. Their third daughter Betty was born in October 2019.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/6c/18/ce/6c18ce3b9448349b449fa2539bc713bf.jpg><p>Likewise, Gosling and Mendes <a href=#>welcomed</a> their first daughter Esmeralda Amada Gosling in September 2014. Mendes gave birth to their second daughter Amada Lee in April 2016.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kv7qtzWapnrGepLmlv4yapZ1loq6ur3nGqKqloZ6ceqmt1Z5koqZdmLyuuc6nZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./arrowhead-pond-to-cut-capacity-in-half.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Arrowhead Pond To Cut Capacity In Half</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./selena-gomez-black-dress-bows-coquette-steve-martin-premiere.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Selena Gomez Wears a Bow-Lined LBD to Steve Martin's Film Premiere</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amal-clooney-mob-wife-trend-cream-fur-coat.html>Amal Clooney Elevates the Mob Wife Trend in a Cream Fur Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./demolition-underway-at-washington-elementary-davenport.html>Demolition underway at Washington Elementary, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iowa-man-killed-in-head-on-crash.html>Iowa man killed in head-on crash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./style-edit-richard-milles-technically-ambitious-new-rm-30-01-automatic-luxury-watch-was-inspired.html>Style Edit: Richard Milles technically ambitious new RM 30-01 Automatic luxury watch was inspired</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./463481-what-happened-frankie-lons-life-story-death.html>What happened to Frankie Lons?
