It’s said Ashley Judd can’t live in the house where her mom suddenly died via suicide last year. The singer’s sudden passing caused shockwaves across the world as fans, fellow A-listers and her family paid tribute.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ashley-judd-moves-out-of-home-where-her-mom-died>Ashley Judd moves out of home where her mom died</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/08/GettyImages-74735266-1024x607.jpg><p>The Kiss The Girls star has put her Tennessee house up for rent for $10,000 a month, Radar Online reports.</p><p>Insiders <a href=# rel=nofollow>claimed</a> the heartbreaking decision came after her therapist spoke to the <a href=#>celebrity</a> over moving on.</p><p><a href=#>Music</a> legend Naomi Judd tragically died after from self-inflicted gunshot wounds in April 2022. She was 76 at the time.</p><p>Ashley, 55, has moved out as the house she was living in was on the same property where her mom passed away.</p><p>A source claimed: “Ashley has been in intensive therapy ever since&nbsp;Naomi’s suicide, and one thing her therapist suggested to get her out of her funk was to shake up her life and start anew”.</p><p>Another insider also said she was with her mom on that tragic day. They say she is still struggling with what took place.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Nightmares and horrifying flashbacks</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>It comes after Ashley <a href=# rel=nofollow>told</a> the New York Times the trauma of what happened affected her in the months following the tragedy.</p><p>She said she suffered from nightmares and crying in her sleep over the flashbacks of her mom’s death.</p><p>Ashley said: “Trauma took up all of the space inside me”.</p><p>The <a href=#>Hollywood</a> actor sought help from a therapist to help make the haunting memories less vivid and impactful. She learned to store them in a “safe place” in a mental location in her mind. This was so they were not “constantly” appearing.</p><p>It comes as Ashley’s half-sister, Wynonna Judd, headed back to Los Angeles and moved out of the house because of the tragic death.</p><p>Naomi’s mental <a href=#>health</a> went undiagnosed and she didn’t receive treatment. The Divergent star later said her mom had post-traumatic stress disorder and bipolar disorder. Ashley spoke of how her mom’s childhood trauma of experiencing sexual abuse, teen pregnancy and dealing with the loss of her brother effected her.</p><p>In January of this year, Ashley threw a birthday party in memory of her mom. It would have been her 77th birthday. Guests were invited to celebrate the country singer, and they told their favorite stories about Naomi.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Talk to someone</h2><p>If you are affected by any issues raised in the article or would like someone to speak to, please call the Samaritans for free on 116 123.
