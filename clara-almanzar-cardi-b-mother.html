Although she could be strict at times, it resulted in the girls growing up to lead successful lives and having an amazing relationship with their mother. Here are some interesting facts about Clara Almánzar</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=clara-almanzar-is-57-years-old>Clara Almánzar is 57 years old</h3><p>Clara Mercedes Almánzar, born on September 19th, 1965, is 57 years old as of 2022. However, her youthful appearance gives the impression that she could easily pass for Cardi B’s twin or sister – you would never guess she was in her late 50s! Her age-defying looks are truly remarkable and it’s no wonder why people mistake her for being much younger than she is.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=she-is-from-trinidad-with-afro-latin-roots>She is from Trinidad with Afro-Latin roots</h3><p>Though little is known about Almánzar’s personal history, it has been revealed that Cardi B’s parents are of Dominican and Trinidadian heritage. This knowledge provides insight into the cultural background which has shaped her upbringing.</p><p>Cardi B’s mother is believed to have been born in Trinidad before the family relocated to the US. She has an Afro-Latino ethnic background, with African and Spanish ancestry.</p><p>Cardi B is of mixed ethnic background, with African, Spanish, Trinidadian, and Dominican heritage. Her father hails from the Dominican Republic which makes<a href=#> Cardi B</a> an Afro-Latino by her identification. This combination of different cultures has had a profound influence on her life and career as she draws inspiration from each one to create something truly unique.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=clara-almanzar-was-married-to-carlos-almanzar>Clara Almánzar was married to Carlos Almánzar</h2><p>Clara Almánzar is Cardi B’s mother and the wife of Carlos Almánzar, who is the father of Cardi B. While Almánzar has seen some time in the spotlight, not much is known about her husband Carlos.</p><p>Clara Almánzar and Carlos’ relationship is largely unknown, but they tied the knot in 1991. One year later, Almánzar welcomed Cardi B into the world. Sadly, their union ended around 2005 when Cardi was only 13 years old.</p><p>Cardi B has a tremendous amount of admiration for her mother, who single-handedly raised her following the divorce. To support Cardi and their family, her mother worked extra shifts which required immense dedication and sacrifice on her part. The rapper is forever grateful for all that was done for them during those times.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=she-has-12-siblings>She has 12 siblings</h3><p>Cardi B was raised in a large, close-knit family environment; her mother has twelve siblings and her ex-husband is from an equally expansive family with eight siblings. Growing up, Cardi B’s extended family lived in the same neighborhood allowing for frequent visits between all of the many aunts, uncles, and cousins.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=she-has-another-daughter>She has another daughter</h3><p>In 1995, Clara and Carlos Almánzar expanded their family with the birth of their second daughter, Hennessy Carolina. Although she may not be as well known as her elder sister Cardi B, Hennessy is a star in her own right. Both sisters are shining examples of the Almánzar family’s success!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Clara-Almanzar-with-her-daughters-Cardi-B-jpg.webp><p>Hennessy is a multi-faceted individual; she is a model and social media influencer, fashion designer, and entrepreneur with her clothing line and was formerly part of the supporting cast in the popular reality TV show Love & Hip Hop. With such an impressive resume, it’s no wonder why Hennessy has achieved success in many areas.</p><p>Hennessy is credited with giving Cardi B her nickname. The rapper’s real name, Belcalis Marlenis Almánzar, was given a similar twist when Hennessy opted to call her sister Bacardi (a rum brand), which eventually became shortened to Cardi B as the artist gained fame and recognition. This just goes to show how influential Hennessy has been in helping shape the career of one of today’s most popular rappers.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=she-lived-in-the-bronx>She lived in the Bronx</h3><p>Clara Almánzar raised Cardi B and her sister Hennessy in Highbridge, a neighborhood located in The Bronx, New York. This area is predominantly comprised of Hispanic and African-American communities and has historically been associated with low-income households.</p><p>Cardi B is immensely proud of her heritage, attributing it to the development of her strength and resilience. She has a deep connection with Washington Heights, where she spent time visiting her paternal grandmother’s home. This experience has allowed Cardi B to gain an appreciation for where she comes from and embrace all that makes up who she is today.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=clara-used-to-work-as-a-cashier>Clara&nbsp;used to work as a cashier</h3><p>Cardi B is an example of someone who has achieved great success despite coming from humble beginnings. She was raised in a low-income family where her parents had to work regular, low-paying jobs; for instance, her mother worked as a cashier at the local grocery store in The Bronx. Despite these difficult circumstances, Cardi B has been able to reach new heights and become one of today’s most successful artists.</p><p>Clara’s husband was a taxi driver, while Cardi B has shared that her mother took on two jobs to provide for the family after their divorce. This demonstrates the strength of both Clara and Cardi B’s mother in overcoming difficult circumstances and providing for their families.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=she-was-a-strict-parent>She was a strict parent</h3><p>Growing up, Cardi B’s parents were very protective of her and her younger sister due to their neighborhood environment. As a result, they enforced strict rules which included not being allowed out much, attending parties, or having sleepovers; something that Cardi B has attributed to the disciplinarian nature of her mother.</p><p>When Cardi B’s parents got divorced, her life changed drastically. With her father no longer present in the household and her mother working two jobs to make ends meet, she was often left alone and unsupervised. This presented an opportunity for Cardi B to explore activities that had previously been forbidden or off-limits due to parental restrictions.</p><p>Cardi B had a difficult adolescence, often choosing to attend parties instead of going to school which resulted in her poor academic performance. As she grew older, Cardi B started spending time with gang members and eventually joined a gang. Her mother Clara was so concerned about her behavior that she decided to kick Cardi B out of the house shortly before her 18th birthday.</p><p>Cardi B is immensely grateful for the strict parenting she received from her mother, as it has enabled her to avoid becoming a teen mom or worse. Having experienced this style of upbringing firsthand, Cardi now understands why her mother was so strict and has even adopted the same no-sleepover policy when raising her children. This shows how much appreciation she holds for what could have been a difficult childhood experience.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=she-was-not-happy-to-learn-that-cardi-b-was-a-strip-per>She was not happy to learn that Cardi B was a strip*per</h2><p>Cardi B was forced to leave her home and move in with her boyfriend. She took a job at a local supermarket but was let go after several months due to frequent lateness. With no income and stuck in an abusive relationship she desperately wanted out of, Cardi B resorted to stripping as a means of survival.</p><p>Cardi B has always been open and honest about her past as a stripper but kept it a secret from her mother due to the strictness of their relationship. To cover up the truth, she would claim that she was making money babysitting at $100 per day. In an interview, Cardi revealed that when her mother found out what she was doing for work, she became so angry that even resorted to physical violence by punching Cardi in rage.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=clara-almanzar-is-close-with-her-daughters>Clara Almánzar is close with her daughters</h2><p>Clara Almánzar and Cardi B had a difficult relationship at one point, but have since reconciled to become close. The two are often seen together in public, with Almánzar providing support for her daughter even through the birth of her child.

Initially, Clara was not accepting of Hennessy’s sexual orientation when she came out to her; however, after some time and effort on both sides, the two were able to open up their hearts and build a strong bond. In an interview, Hennessy said that she was now accepted by her mother which is something for which they are both grateful.</p><p>Clara may not be widely known, but she has been a key figure in her daughters’ successes. Despite financial struggles, she worked diligently to provide for them; at one point even took on two positions after the divorce from her husband. Her dedication and commitment are inspirational examples of what can be achieved through hard work and determination.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Marilyn Nault: NBA Legend Bill Russell’s third wife</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=who-is-clara-almanzars-daughter-cardi-b>Who Is Clara Almánzar’s Daughter, Cardi B?</h2><p>Cardi B, real name Belcalis Marlenis Almánzar, is the daughter of Almánzar and has become a celebrated star in the entertainment industry.
