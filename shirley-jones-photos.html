Shirley Jones has charmed audiences on stage and screen for seven decades. Jones effortlessly transitioned from stage to delightful movie musicals to compelling dramas on the silver screen — and even earned an Academy Award for her performance in Elmer Gantry. But the 89-year-old is best known as the beloved matriarch of the hit television series The Partridge Family, where she become an emblem of warmth, love and music in the early 1970s.</p><p>Join us as we take a walk down memory lane with a look at the life, loves and career of Shirley Jones, whose enduring legacy continues to inspire and enchant us all.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Growing up Shirley Jones</h2><p>Born on March 31, 1934, Shirley Jones was aptly named after <a href=#>child star Shirley Temple</a>. When Jones was just a toddler, the family moved to a small nearby town of Smithton where her father helped run the family-owned brewery, the Jones Brewing Company (still operating todsay as <a href=#>Stoney’s Beer</a>) and she began singing at the age of six in the Methodist Church choir and took voice lessons in town.&nbsp;</p><p>Believe it or not, the gifted singer actually planned to become a veterinarian as a teenager. “I adored animals, raised everything in the world and decided that was going to be what I was going to do.&nbsp; <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">But I could sing</a>,” Jones said on NPR‘s Wait Wait…Don’t Tell Me!</p><p>But acting also intrigued Jones, and while attending South Huntingdon High School in Ruffs Dale, Pennsylvania, she participated in school plays.&nbsp;It was in 1952 that she won the Miss Pittsburgh contest and also had a small role in Gruen Guild Playhouse.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Shirley Jones takes on Broadway</h2><p>In 1953, on a post-high school graduation trip to New York City with her parents, a friend introduced her to an agent who was immediately impressed, and told her to attend an open audition with John Fearnley, the casting director for the infamous songwriting duo <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rodgers and Hammerstein</a>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/skjff-edited.jpg><p>After Jones’ audition, Feamley asked her, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“What have you done?”</a> in reference to her previous productions.&nbsp;When she responded, “Nothing,” he brought over Richard Rodgers who was rehearsing with his orchestra across the street, and then came Hammerstein.</p><p>That became Jones’ fortuitous introduction to the Broadway legends, who would become her mentors.&nbsp;The two saw great potential in a young Shirley Jones — so much so, that Jones was the first and only singer to be put under personal contract with the songwriters.&nbsp;</p><p>“I was a small-town girl and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">had no idea who Rodgers and Hammerstein even were</a>,” she confessed to Closer.&nbsp; “Two weeks later, I was in my first Broadway show, South Pacific.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>For Jones’ second Broadway show, Me and Juliet, she moved up to a chorus girl and then went to the understudy for the lead role in Chicago. She soon caught the eye of movie producers and was dubbed, “Hollywood’s new Cinderella,” as Jones recounts in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">her self-titled memoir</a>.&nbsp; And Jones indeed quickly turned into a Hollywood royalty, and has been going strong ever since.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Shirley Jones Movies and TV Shows</h2><p>With a career that’s taken place over several decades, here’s a look at some of Shirley Jones’ most iconic roles and career defining moments.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Shirley Jones in 1955</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/07/hfjfjf.jpg><p>Shirley Jones starred in the 1955 musical film, Oklahoma!, alongside Gordon MacRae.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>1956</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/07/jjfjf.jpg><p>Rodgers and Hammerstein’s Carousel was another one of Shirley Jones’ musical endeavors, again putting her alongside Gordon MacRae.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Shirley Jones in 1956</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/shutterstock_editorial_1951392a-edited.jpg><p>On August 5, 1956, Jones married actor, singer, and Tony winner, Jack Cassidy.&nbsp;She had met Cassidy as a 21-year-old small town girl.&nbsp; “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">He taught me a lot about everything</a>,” Jones says in her memoir.&nbsp;Together they raised four sons: David Cassidy was Jack’s son from his first marriage, then together they had Shaun, Patrick and Ryan Cassidy.</p><p>Hollywood knew of Jack’s unfaithful adventures, but it was his penchant for alcohol that the couple divorced in 1975.
