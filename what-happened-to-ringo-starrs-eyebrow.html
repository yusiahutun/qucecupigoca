As we’ve now discovered, Ringo’s grey and misshapen eyebrow was not caused by premature aging, but rather by illness. But which illness? Was it the TB? Appendicitis, or any of the other illnesses he suffered when growing up? Well, possibly. While it is not official, many have speculated that the most likely cause of Starr’s grey eyebrow was Poliosis.</p><p>Poliosis is a condition characterized by a single grey or white patch appearing on an otherwise healthy and colorful head of hair.</p><p>Poliosis occurs due to a lack of a pigment known as melanin, from a small area of hair follicles.</p><p>It is likely, that he had this on one part of his head, and of course, on his left eyebrow.</p><p>As far as what causes Poliosis, it can be caused by any number of things.</p><p>Sometimes other illnesses can trigger it, which is likely with Ringo considering he was such a sickly child, though it can also be genetic, or caused stress and/or pain, which can also trigger flare-ups.</p><p>Considering Ringo first started experiencing these symptoms when he was in the hospital recovering from TB, it’s likely that illness was the trigger.</p><h2><strong>Did Ringo always try hiding his eyebrow?</strong></h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-55960 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/What-happened-to-Ringo-Starrs-left-eyebrow.jpg.webp alt="What happened to Ringo Starr's left eyebrow" width=1200 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/What-happened-to-Ringo-Starrs-left-eyebrow.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-4 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-55960 class=wp-caption-text>@Getty</p><p>Despite hiding his grey eyebrow early on in his career, as he became more famous and comfortable in front of audiences, he began embracing his unique eyebrow.</p><p>From 1964, Ringo would often not bother disguising his eyebrow with makeup and was often spotted sporting one dark eyebrow and one grey eyebrow, which was barely visible in certain lights.</p><p>As fame and the rock and roll lifestyle took hold of Starr, however, he succumbed to the vices that go with it and would drink heavily, party, use drugs, and would suffer from addiction and mental health disorders as a result.</p><p>While in Monaco in 1976, Starr suffered a very public mental breakdown and, after drinking far too much alcohol, and using various substances, he would shave his hair off completely, along with his eyebrows.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=#>How is J Earnhardt related to Dale Jr</a>?</p><h2><strong>How is Ringo looking nowadays?</strong></h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-75832 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/what-happened-to-ringos-eyebrow.jpg.webp alt="what happened to ringos eyebrow" width=1200 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/what-happened-to-ringos-eyebrow.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-5 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-75832 class=wp-caption-text>Ringo Starr attends Ringo’s Annual Peace & Love Birthday Celebration on July 07, 2023 in Beverly Hills – @Getty</p><p>Fortunately, after his breakdown, Ringo decided to clean up his act, and he stopped using drugs and drinking, and began looking after himself.</p><p>Today, aged 82, Ringo goes to the gym 5, 6, or even 7 times a week.</p><p>He states that he doesn’t smoke anymore or drink, and that he is a vegetarian and likes to eat broccoli, blueberries, and other superfoods to help him be healthy, feel better, and look better.</p><p>Starr is in great shape, his hair is dark (almost certainly dyed), and he looks decades younger.</p><p>As far as his eyebrow goes, as Ringo is rarely seen in public without a pair of sunglasses on, we don’t actually know how it looks, but we’d wager it looks great.</p><p>So, what happened to Ringo Starr’s eyebrow?
