And the duo has fallen victim to a few rumors.</p><p>The most searched thing about them is their chemistry and whether they had something going on in real life. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Theo James and Shailene Woodley's Relationship during Divergent Films</h2><p>James and Woodley began their journey on the Divergent series almost six months apart. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>It was Woodley who got the cast&nbsp;first in October 2012. Then, James was chosen to be Four in March 2013.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The duo had instant chemistry, as James recalled it. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Veronica Roth, the author of the Divergent book series, was thrilled at the main character castings. She also immediately noticed the chemistry between the two. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>James, too,&nbsp;has talked about this chemistry. During an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview with Culture Calling</a> in 2017, he recalled how he and Woodley instantly connected.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>"Shai and I had good chemistry from the first moment we met," The Witcher actor said. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>He mentioned how he had the chance to see Woodley, and their friendship, grow during their time together on sets and&nbsp;promotional activities.</p><p>Woodley had similar feelings&nbsp;as Roth about James being the right actor to play Four.</p><p>But, contrary to Roth and James, she did not see their chemistry immediately. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>It took her a bit of time to realize that. But once she watched the movies, she agreed with the others.</p><h2>Kissing Shailene Woodley Was the Toughest Stunt for Theo James</h2><p>During the filming of the movies, James and Woodley performed many stunts, for instance,&nbsp;climbing a Ferris wheel in Chicago.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>But for the actor, none were as difficult as kissing his co-star.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Both of them wanted the kiss scene to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">be as good as possible</a>. Therefore, they put in a lot of effort to get the scene&nbsp;right. They even re-took the scene as it&nbsp;didn't feel right for them the first time around.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p><strong>During the Divergent series' filming, Theo James and Shailene Woodley's great relationship started their dating rumors.</strong> (Photo: Divergent/Instagram) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The scene also showcases the intricacies of their characters' relationship. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>So, it probably wouldn't be too wrong&nbsp;to speculate that the two had a great understanding of each other to agree on the details and redo an intimate scene.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>But it wasn't difficult kissing her for the first time. The actor <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">told Dazed</a> in 2014:</p><p>It was easy, to be honest. I’ve said this before: I think sometimes you have to make stuff happen chemistry-wise. You have to force it. But when you don’t and it’s very real and natural, that makes for the best scenes&nbsp;and&nbsp;also the most fun because if you have natural chemistry you can have fun and you can build on that.</p><h2>Theo James and Shailene Woodley Developed a Great Friendship</h2><p>The co-stars bonded a lot over their time together in&nbsp;the movies.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>During an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview with Buzzfeed</a> in 2016, they shared thoughts about one another.</p><p>While discussing a hypothetical question about going beyond the wall (a reference from the movies), they both picked each other as their ideal pick among the cast members.</p><p>They even agreed on their fondest memories from filming. The two spent their off days together out on the lake in&nbsp;Atlanta.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In response to a fan's&nbsp;question about what he would miss about Woodley and working with her, James said, "Every single thing. Having a partner in crime, yo. It's good to have someone having your back."</p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Speculations about Shailene Woodley and Theo James's Romantic Ties</h2><p>This amazing on-screen chemistry and off-screen friendship led&nbsp;people to ask questions about whether they had something going on romantically in real life.</p><p>At one point in 2017, there were&nbsp;rumors about them dating. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>An <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">article from Inquisitr</a> reports speculations about Woodley causing a delay in James's wedding with longtime girlfriend, Ruth Kearney.</p><p>The piece reported that another site claimed they had been dating before becoming a part of the Divergent franchise.</p><p>Further, they stated that the duo had been very close to one another at the time.</p><p>These were all just speculations, though. James and his now-wife never split.</p><p>Instead, they actually&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>got married in 2018</a> and&nbsp;have a small family now, having <a href=# rel=follow>welcomed a baby in 2021</a>.</p><p>As for Woodley, she is <a href=# rel=follow>in a relationship with</a> fiance Aaron Rodgers.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKyYmrxutsCmnKxlo52uqrjEp5xmr5%2Bksa2x2GapnqSRqbawutKhoKlmmKm6rQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kristy-althaus.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Kristy Althaus dating?
