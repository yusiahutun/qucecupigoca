The enormous folds and fault structures formed by crustal movement make the geology in the mountains extremely unstable.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chinese engineers have long said the best way to cross the geographically unstable terrain is through tunnels. They once firmly believed that sudden geological disasters such as landslides and earthquakes would have a severe impact on surface structures but would cause relatively minor damage to underground projects – and even if the damage reached the tunnels, it would be relatively easy to repair.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/12/11/0be0ed78-b9ae-4140-86c4-dde5f35140b3_8ac71a37.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, Chinese engineers and scientists are now starting to realise that their textbooks might have been wrong and tunnels may not be the solution.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The severe deformation and damage caused by earthquake destruction to tunnels, as well as the difficulty of engineering repairs, prove that tunnels are not an effective way to resist engineering faults,” engineers from the China Railway First Survey and Design Institute wrote in a paper published in the domestic Journal of Geomechanics on November 24.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Therefore, in railway engineering risk selection, tunnel methods should be avoided when crossing relatively dangerous active fault zones.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Are high-speed trains becoming Xi Jinping’s preferred way to travel in China?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to the paper, the Chinese engineers changed their minds completely after an earthquake on January 8 last year. Engineers say they are still haunted today by the magnitude 6.9 earthquake that occurred in Menyuan County, Qinghai province in northwestern China, with the epicentre just 4.5km from a high-speed rail.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The earthquake caused a new fault tens of kilometres long to form, with the new fault zone straddled by an important high-speed rail tunnel. Engineers who rushed to the scene after the disaster were shocked to see that the tunnel had been cut off by the force of the quake, with a horizontal displacement of 3 metres (10 feet) between the two sections and a vertical drop of more than 1 metre.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While repairing distorted rail tracks and broken wall surfaces is routine for engineers, reconnecting two almost parallel misaligned tunnels and ensuring that high-speed trains pass through without any problems was a significant challenge.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">China’s railway workers and engineers applied tremendous effort to solve the problem and finally restored full operation of the high-speed railway in July. Construction of the entire line took just five years.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">During the tunnel repair period, the Chinese government and state-owned railway companies upgraded and improved the entire railway, increasing its operating speed by a quarter, to 250km/h (155mph). Although it falls well short of the 350km/h in other parts of China, the difficult terrain has pushed modern engineering technology to its limits.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, engineers remain concerned for the future, writing in the paper that they recommend strengthening “real-time monitoring of post-earthquake deformation across active fault zones, real-time changes in stress in engineering sites, and surface cracks in tunnel areas after tunnel repair and operation”.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/11/14/clean.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">01:47</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">China-Laos railway adds connection from Beijing to Vientiane</p><p>China-Laos railway adds connection from Beijing to Vientiane</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The total cost of the Lanxin Express is as high as 143.5 billion yuan (US$20 billion), and each suspension may cause losses of hundreds of millions of yuan.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It is not known how this expensive lesson will affect future construction of China’s high-speed rail network, but public reports indicate the builders of some lines are trying to build bridges in valleys to cross difficult and dangerous terrain.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As the engineers said in the paper, their suggestions only target some specific locations, and most existing high-speed rail tunnels are not likely to pose this risk. So far, no other lines have been suspended at the same frequency as the Lanxin Express.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Xi’s Vietnam visit set to focus on rail link, rare earths amid rising US clout</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In less than 15 years, China has constructed more than 40,000km of high-speed railways, connecting nearly all major cities. There have been no passenger deaths caused by accidents in the past decade and the safety record of high-speed railways has surpassed that of aeroplanes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">China’s high-speed rail technology has been used in some countries such as Indonesia and Thailand, and many others have shown interest in introducing it. How to maintain an impeccable safety record abroad is a new challenge for Chinese engineers and scientists.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miaoaGelny0r8iepZydX5a%2FtbXCpZxoa2JpgXd%2Fl2isp6SlmLiqsdKtZKGhl516tLzEnptmqpGeuW60zrBkpqeknbKzec2aq66qlWKvprrDrGShrZ2Wu27DyKWjZqqVmLyzsIybqZ6Zm567qHnIp52rmaOpv7av066pnmWnmsC1sdGn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./audubon-of-martin-county-president-john-nelson-discovered-his-love-for-floridas-wildlife-while-on-a-trip-to-africa.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Audubon Of Martin County President John Nelson Discovered His Love For Floridas Wildlife While On</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./nature-photographers-to-follow-for-inspiration-2.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Nature Photographers to Follow For Inspiration</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amal-clooney-mob-wife-trend-cream-fur-coat.html>Amal Clooney Elevates the Mob Wife Trend in a Cream Fur Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./demolition-underway-at-washington-elementary-davenport.html>Demolition underway at Washington Elementary, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iowa-man-killed-in-head-on-crash.html>Iowa man killed in head-on crash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./style-edit-richard-milles-technically-ambitious-new-rm-30-01-automatic-luxury-watch-was-inspired.html>Style Edit: Richard Milles technically ambitious new RM 30-01 Automatic luxury watch was inspired</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./463481-what-happened-frankie-lons-life-story-death.html>What happened to Frankie Lons?
