"Just 'cause you don't regret something now doesn't mean that one day you won't regret it. So things may be still hot for him, and it is still very raw."</p><p>The reality star doubled down on her theory and said that watching season 13 of RHONJ may change his mind about their relationship.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:026da224-7f0d-4664-9f34-b92d8e3851ae data-container-ref=toofab:article:7d14ce42-baf3-431e-915d-74dd3f33e2ea data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/45/5by4/2022/05/11/450bfbba8cd745dabc7948d24e09732c_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Andy Cohen Tells Everyone to 'Shut Up' on RHONJ Reunion, Snaps at Teresa for 'Demeaning' Joe</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"Plus, the season hasn't even aired yet, so we are going to relive all these moments over again," she explained. "In addition to that, [we’ll] see what people said about us in confessionals — which could always be very hurtful. So [it] kind of like builds up the feelings all over again. So I don't think that he'll regret it maybe anytime soon, but I do feel that one day he will regret it."</p><p>However, Joe felt the opposite and revealed that he had no feelings of regret. "I made a decision, and I don’t regret anything I do," he told the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">publication</a>.</p><p>Instead, the real estate developer stated that he would only feel regret if he was his sister, "I would regret it if that was me and everything's reversed. I'd be kicking myself in the ass every day," he said.</p><p>Teresa and Joe have had a rocky relationship throughout the years, and things came to a head when Melissa and Joe decided not to attend her big day.</p><p>"That's my only family. So, what do you think? Yeah, it was devastating," Teresa confessed at Bravocon. "I mean, the day before [our wedding], I was in tears 'cause I just found out. It was heartbreaking [because] it's my only family, and Luis was hurting for me. My children were hurting. But then [on] that day, that day was our day."</p><a id=gallery-link-9c92f1d7-21e4-45d9-9d8a-af17f5769583 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:9c92f1d7-21e4-45d9-9d8a-af17f5769583 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:7d14ce42-baf3-431e-915d-74dd3f33e2ea data-gallery-layout=list><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/06/4by3/2022/10/15/0677d38e7d9b4d7faef5ec7305b222a1_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3N7kGlmam9fn7KvusifnKtlka6xqrqMmqOlnZeasa3FjK2fq6enqHqlvsinomaZpGK3sLGMoKarn5Fir7Ot1aiaqKZf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./taniqua-smith-bio-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Taniqua Smith Bio: Facts about DeMarcus Wares Ex-Wife</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-to-install-software-from-third-party-ppas-in-ubuntu.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How to Install Software from Third-Party PPAs in Ubuntu</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amal-clooney-mob-wife-trend-cream-fur-coat.html>Amal Clooney Elevates the Mob Wife Trend in a Cream Fur Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./demolition-underway-at-washington-elementary-davenport.html>Demolition underway at Washington Elementary, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iowa-man-killed-in-head-on-crash.html>Iowa man killed in head-on crash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./style-edit-richard-milles-technically-ambitious-new-rm-30-01-automatic-luxury-watch-was-inspired.html>Style Edit: Richard Milles technically ambitious new RM 30-01 Automatic luxury watch was inspired</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./463481-what-happened-frankie-lons-life-story-death.html>What happened to Frankie Lons?
