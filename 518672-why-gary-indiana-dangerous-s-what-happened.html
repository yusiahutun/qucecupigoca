The region has been chiefly dominated by <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">massive industrial activity</a> and is home to U.S. Steel’s Gary Works, North America's biggest steel mill complex.</p><p class=align-left>Gary lies in the southern end of Lake Michigan, east of Chicago. The city was named after Elbert H. Gary, the chief organiser of the United States Steel Corporation.</p><p class=align-left>According to the 2020 <a href=#>census</a>, Gary's population was 69,093, making it Indiana’s <a href=#>ninth-largest city</a>. The city was the scene of the early 20th-century development of public education when William Wirt created the work-study-play school, known as the platoon school. It was designed to attract underprivileged children.</p><p class=align-left>Unfortunately, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">manufacturing was reduced</a>, and employment at the USX fell by more than 20,000, resulting in 7,500 at the 20th century's end. This resulted in a high poverty rate in the region.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ca874f923fda2f58.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 heaviest buildings in the world that you should know about</span></p></a><h2 id=518672-why-is-gary-indiana-so-dangerous class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Why is Gary, Indiana so dangerous?</h2><p class=align-left>Gary is deemed dangerous because of its high crime rate. In 1993, it became the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">murder capital</a> of the United States of America after the population of over 100,000 saw a record of 110 killed. The rate was three times that of Chicago.</p><p class=align-left>In 1995, Gary had a population of 115,269 and over 3,000 <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">reported crimes</a>. That year, there were 129 murders in the city, making it one of the most violent cities in the United States of America.</p><p class=align-left>Notably, in 2019, the average<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> violent crime rate</a> was 366.7 per 100,000 residents, and the national average for property crime was 2,109.9 per 100,000.</p><p class=align-left>During this time, Gary’s crime rate was 554.31 per 100,000 residents and a property crime rate of 3,556.17 per 100,000 residents.

Gary, Indiana, is severely declining after it was built on the back of the manufacturing industry. The city has ditched factories and buildings vacated years ago, and no one seems interested in reviving them.</p><p class=align-left>Gary's reliance on steel manufacturing was its <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">ultimate downfall</a>. Importing steel became cheaper, and it made no sense to produce it in Gary, and the city lost its glory from the reduced production capacity resulting from low demand.</p><p class=align-left>At the height of the steel manufacturing industry in the 1970s, Gary employed over 30,000. However, the number had declined to around 6,000 by the 1990s and reduced to 5,100 by August 2015.</p><p class=align-left>Today, the job sector in the city has never recovered, and any attempts to take a notch higher have failed. The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">median household income</a> in Gary, Indiana, is $31,936, and the median value of a home in the city is $66,100. The poverty rate is three times the national average.

Once the thriving steel manufacturing <a href=#>business</a> went down, the city's businesses had to close down one by one as there wasn’t sufficient income to sustain them.
