While once a rarity, you can now find motored models everywhere from college campuses to office parks to mountain biking trails.</p><p>Today we're looking at the new Metakoo Cybertrack 300. It’s a 27.5-inch e-mountain bike designed for effortless trail-riding. You can buy it on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Metakoo’s website for $899</a>. But does it deserve to be crowned king of the mountain?</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=the-metakoo-cybertrack-300-features>The Metakoo Cybertrack 300: Features</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Metakoo-Right-Shifter.jpg><p>There are two categories of features here, first are the mechanical elements of this unit. Second are the e-bike-specific features. We’re going to go over both individually here, so riders know exactly what they’re getting for their money.</p><h3 id=bike-features>Bike Features</h3><p>For the bike itself, the Metakoo Cybertrack 300 is a 27.5-inch, all-aluminum, 21-speed, hardtail unit that features Shimano gears, adjustable front suspension, and front and rear mechanical disc brakes. It also sports a Prowheel crankset.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>The recommended rider height for a unit like this is between 5’7” and 6’5”. Though, I’m 5’4” and could ride this bike with the seat positioned at the lowest point. Despite my testing, I don’t recommend this bike as the first pick for shorter riders, as I still had to lean it over to get a foot on the ground. The maximum weight rating is 308 lbs (139.70 kg).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Shimano-rear-gear-set-metakoo-two.jpg><p>The shifters on the bike are the often-coveted Shimano Tourney SL-TX30s, which control Shimano Tourney TZ front and rear derailleurs. While not the absolute best in shifting hardware, they get the job done. Trigger shifters are a personal preference, but many people swear by the bulkier Tourney series. Weight here is just a hair under 51 lbs or about 23 kilograms.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>The whole package rolls on a set of aggressive 27.5 × 2.10 Compass tires rated for 40-60 PSI. Finally, on the left rear of the Cybertrack 300 is an adjustable kickstand, which I have learned to despise.</p><h3 id=e-bike-features>E-Bike Features</h3><p>This bike is primarily a pedal-assisted style e-bike with a max top speed of 20 mph (32.19 km/h). It does offer a pure throttle mode, but the throttle doesn’t stay engaged unless you’re actively using it. Powering this rear-drive e-bike is a 48 volt, 500W Vinka RH75-H500 motor that offers 50 Newton-meters of torque and 750 peak watts. Speed is monitored via a sensor, which means that there is a possibility to bypass the limiter. But we’re not going to get into that here.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>The 499.2 watt-hour battery takes only around 3 hours to charge from flat to full. With a full battery, expect 30-40 miles when using the pedal-assist and a max of 30 if you’re cranking the throttle in pure electric mode. Of course, rider weight and road conditions will come into play here, so expect the mileage to be a bit less than claimed on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Metakoo website</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Metakoo-Battery-Door.jpg><p>The battery locks onto the frame for safety and keeps sticky-fingered folks from disconnecting it. In addition, a small rotating dust cover keeps the charger port from getting debris inside and helps hold the charger in place when plugged in. This cover’s function is a small but welcome detail, as the charger doesn’t feel the most secure when plugged in.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Metakoo-Prowheel-Crankset.jpg><p>The Vinka LCD on the unit allows you to adjust top speed when using the throttle, so you can dial in your ride at the speed you prefer. There are five levels here, with setting one being the lowest and setting five being the 20-mph maximum. I liked the number five setting, as I am a fan of fast.</p><p>The display also lets you see battery level, motor power, speed mode, and total mileage ridden. This display also uses MPH rather than KPH, which US riders will appreciate.</p><p>These features make for an e-bike that is a lot of fun to ride. It also has enough power to help you push through steeper climbs so that you can enjoy the downhills a bit more.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Is an E-Bike?</a></span></p><h2 id=unboxing-and-setup>Unboxing and Setup</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Metakoo-right-side-facing-fence.jpg><p>The Cybertrack 300 arrives in a rather large Metakoo box. Cutting open this box first revealed the bike frame with the rear wheel attached. Inside the box were the front wheel, the saddle, pedals, a quick-release axle, a single disc brake, two reflectors, the battery, a charger, the rear derailleur protecting rack, and all associated hardware and tools.</p><p>Furthermore, the manual and a “greeting card” were stuffed into the package. The bike-shaped card contained a QR code that you could use to link to an instructional video for putting the bike together. I didn’t watch the video. However, I wish I would have, as it might have saved me about fifteen minutes of removing the front disc after installing it incorrectly.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Metakoo-Rear-Motor.jpg><p>Setting this unit up was simple, and if you’ve put a bike together before, you won’t have much trouble. However, even if you haven’t, the instructions walk you through each step of the process. Total assembly time was about an hour, not counting charging.</p><h2 id=city-riding-with-the-cybertrack-300>City Riding With the Cybertrack 300</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>My first trip on this bike was through the streets of my city. While this wasn’t the underbrush, I live in an area with rampant potholes and generally uneven roads. I figured that was enough of a first test to feel how the Cybertrack 300 would perform.</p><p>On the back of this bike, cruising around the neighborhood was a delightful experience. At the highest speed setting, pedal-assist had me flying down the road at 20-mph—which felt pretty fast.</p><p>The adjustable suspension stood out to me. Typically, the construction zones scattered around my city get a bit treacherous when riding my fixed gear. However, with the Cybertrack 300, my ride was sturdy and stable.</p><p>While the bike’s weight did make it a bit less responsive than my steel-framed fixie, I would say it’s a lot like driving a comfortable luxury vehicle versus driving a tuned sports car.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>For the next two weeks, I used this bike exclusively for my 16-mile, twice-a-week commute. While not specifically trail-riding, I wanted to make sure I spent some significant time in the saddle. My commute was the best way to guarantee I had adequate riding time before writing this review. I also wanted to put the bike through some extreme urban riding.</p><p>Aside from a single flat tire, I had no problems. The motor makes navigating hills shockingly easy, and the knobby tires are excellent for the different types of terrain that I encounter on typical rides.</p><p>Of course, not everyone will want the Cybertrack 300 for this type of riding, so let’s discuss how it performs on the trail.</p><h2 id=trail-riding-with-the-cybertrack-300>Trail Riding With the Cybertrack 300</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Early one Saturday morning, I took this bike out to the Blue Hills Reservation in Eastern Massachusetts to see how it handled rocky off-road terrain. As a mountain biker, though, I’m not highly experienced. So, I stayed off the more advanced trails and opted for a slightly less intense ride.</p><p>I tried, however, to see how much the Cybertrack 300 could take before it started feeling squirrelly. With super steep grades, though, the motor wasn’t helpful, even at level five. I also had to hop off the bike just to get back into the flats a couple of times. For hardcore pedal pushers, this might not be a problem.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Based on this experience, I don’t think this bike is the best choice for hardcore trail riding. It’s excellent for lighter terrain, but at higher speeds or on rocky paths, the steering, motor power, and weight begin to detract from the benefits of an e-mountain bike. The weighty frame also puts it on the higher end of the spectrum for trail bikes, and it isn’t as nimble in rocky ruts or on technical terrain.</p><p>Some people love hardtail models, but I found the lack of suspension fear-inducing. There were several instances where I was worried that I’d dent a rim when the rear wheel hit larger rocks.</p><p>As an aside: I did manage to dent the rear wheel, but it wasn’t on the trail—instead, that happened when I had to pop up over a large curb. Adjusting this dent with a pair of pliers got it back to good. And the tiny dent didn’t seem to affect the truing of the wheel.</p><p>The good news here is that for all but the steepest grades, the electric components help climb hilly surfaces with significantly less effort than you would use with a standard 21-speed mountain bike. Granted, you’re still going to have to earn your turns, but the motor does make climbing much more manageable.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>For sightseeing trips, family outings, and easy trails, the Cybertrack 300 does great. And as an all-purpose commuter, it’s also pretty awesome.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Fiido D11 Review: Fast Foldable Fun for Less Than $1000</a></span></p><h2 id=battery-life-and-range>Battery Life and Range</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>There is a warning in the owner’s manual that you shouldn’t charge the battery for more than three hours. I mention this because most people will just plug this unit in and leave it to charge. Metakoo doesn’t recommend this, and with a large lithium battery, you shouldn’t leave the bike plugged in constantly.</p><p>I didn’t find any issues in the few times I let the charge time go over the three-hour limit, though. However, I did find that after my 16-mile, round trip commute, the battery was depleted by around three-quarters. That makes me question Metakoo’s 30 to 40-mile range claims.</p><p>Of course, Metakoo states that this maximum range was achieved by a 165-lb individual at 16 mph (25.75 km/h), with no wind. I’m slightly heavier than that, so, based on my experience, I’d gather the max range could be anywhere between 20-25 miles when using full throttle for a person around 180 lbs.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=can-you-repair-the-cybertrack-300>Can You Repair the Cybertrack 300?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Yes. Tires, wheels, brake pads, and the chain are serviceable by amateur bike mechanics and knowledgeable wrench-turners. You probably should stay away from the electronic components, though, unless you know what you’re doing.</p><p>The warranty on this bike is one year on hardware, frame, and battery. Wearable items like brake pads and tires aren’t covered here, but that’s not surprising.</p><p>Related: <span class=related-single><a href=#>Is the Peleton Bike Worth the Hype?</a></span></p><h2 id=what-do-we-love-about-this-e-bike>What Do We Love About This E-Bike?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>In my experience, the best parts about the Cybertrack 300 are the comfortable ride, high torque, and decently long range. I adore the front suspension, though I wish rear suspension was an option. I’m also impressed by how quickly this bike can get up to speed using the throttle alone.</p><p>The five electric speed settings make cruising effortless, and the 21-speed transmission will satisfy purists who think that motors shouldn’t be used unless you’re climbing. The bike is also styled to fit all genders as long as they meet the height requirement. Two colors are available: black and white, so don’t expect to get bright options here unless you’re willing to paint them yourself.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>City riding and light trail riding are also a lot of fun. Furthermore, I’d imagine if you wanted to tow a small trailer with this bike, it wouldn’t be a problem. Additionally, Metakoo properly dialed in gearing and derailleurs from the factory, and assembly wasn’t complicated.</p><p>All of these positives make the Cybertrack 300 a formidable budget bike that I would recommend.</p><h2 id=what-rsquo-s-not-to-love>What’s Not to Love?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>First is going to be the noise level. The motor of this bike emits a slight whine when engaged. It’s not terrible when riding, but you can hear the motor spinning up above any wind noise.</p><p>The brakes are also somewhat noisy. I’m not sure if that issue was specific to my bike or if that’s all models, but even after working them in over about 70 miles (112.65 km), I still haven’t gotten rid of brake squeak. Of course, a little noise is expected for a new bike, but one would think that the brakes would be less harsh on the ears after so many miles.</p><p>I’m also not a fan of the telescoping kickstand on the bike. First, there was no indication that the stand was adjustable in the user’s manual. Second, even after tightening and adjusting the stand to the proper height, I almost dropped the bike at one point due to the stand pushing inward slightly.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Unfortunately, you have to have a hex-head wrench to adjust the stand. That means if it slides inward on you, you can’t adjust it unless you have your toolkit with you. This fact doesn’t seem like a problem until you realize this bike weighs over 50 lbs. It also has delicate electronic components attached, so dropping it isn’t the best idea.</p><p>Finally, the weight of this unit will be a problem for some. It’s not so bad when you’re riding, but this bike is a pain to haul into and out of a vehicle. It’s also not the easiest bike to carry over non-bike-friendly sections of the trail.</p><h2 id=should-you-buy-the-cybertrack-300>Should You Buy the Cybertrack 300?</h2><p>For beginner to intermediate riders, the Cybertrack 300 works great. It’s ideal for those who may not have the endurance to pedal for long periods but still want to enjoy mountain biking. On the other hand, more experienced riders may find the bike lacks extreme hill-bombing capabilities.</p><p>Surprisingly, though, the Cybertrack 300 is fantastic for urban commuting. I would recommend it for folks seeking an alternative to the smaller foldable e-bikes populating the market. It might also be less dorky-looking to some—if that matters to you.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>While using this beast for commuting might sound odd, the additional front suspension and large tires make for a ridiculously comfortable ride. Gravel, construction zones, and even wet grass are no match for this mountain bike. Adding a set of lights offers even more versatility.</p><p>So, if you’re in the market for a bike that can handle light-duty trail work, or if you want to increase your confidence on your daily commute, then the Metakoo Cybertrack 300 is sure to surprise you. In a good way.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGiaspqVp8GzrcKkZGxoYGKyo7XKnmSrnaaesrh7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./66310680268e3e6a498b45b4-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bundesliga: Jan Niklas Beste, la revelacin de la Bundesliga que llama a las puertas de LaLiga</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./time-management-skills.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>5</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amal-clooney-mob-wife-trend-cream-fur-coat.html>Amal Clooney Elevates the Mob Wife Trend in a Cream Fur Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./demolition-underway-at-washington-elementary-davenport.html>Demolition underway at Washington Elementary, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iowa-man-killed-in-head-on-crash.html>Iowa man killed in head-on crash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./style-edit-richard-milles-technically-ambitious-new-rm-30-01-automatic-luxury-watch-was-inspired.html>Style Edit: Richard Milles technically ambitious new RM 30-01 Automatic luxury watch was inspired</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./463481-what-happened-frankie-lons-life-story-death.html>What happened to Frankie Lons?
