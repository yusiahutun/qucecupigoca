Instead, you line your lid with a magnetic liner, which has a similar look and feel to liquid eyeliner and attracts the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>magnets that line the band of each lash</a>. They'll always ensure a secure hold of your falsies, and sometimes, they'll provide a high-pigmented eyeliner look, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In order to find the best magnetic lashes, we rounded up eight testers in our lab to try out 16 top-rated, bestselling sets.

Instead, eight small-but-mighty magnetics line the lash's band and immediately attach to the latex-free liner for all-day wear.

These falsies have a subtle cat-eye tapering that allows them to elongate and volumize the lashes in a natural-looking way, eliminating the unflattering pulling and shape-minimizing effect that others have. Each fluttery lash has six magnets that instantly attach to the Glamnetic magnetic liner and offer long-lasting, waterproof, and smudge-proof wear. They can be reused up to 40 times and they’re also suitable to wear with glasses or eyewear.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Look:</strong> Medium Drama | <strong>Good For: </strong>A variety of eye shapes, but especially hooded eyes | <strong>Material: </strong>Synthetic fiber<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-other-options-we-tested></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Other Options We Tested</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text><a href=#>Ace Beauté Magnetic Lashes</a></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Applying these lashes comes with a small learning curve: The liner is smaller than most and hard to hold when applying. However, once the liner is conquered, applying the falsies is simple. In fact, our tester dubbed it “a breeze.” Made from high-quality, synthetic fibers, these magnetic lashes look just like a fresh set of lash extensions. With 12 magnets included on the strip, you also don’t have to worry about the band slipping and sliding out of place.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text><a href=#>Doe Lashes Magnetic Eyelashes</a></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Made from Korean silk, these falsies are the next best thing to your natural lashes. In fact, our tester even dubbed these some of the softest and most comfortable lashes she had ever worn. That said, she didn’t think they complemented her eye shape well and suggests only purchasing these if you have larger, nonhooded eyes because they look very heavy on smaller eyes.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text><a href=#>Arishine Magnetic Eyeliner and Eyelashes Kit</a></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Applying these lashes was “simple and quick,” according to our testers—music to our ears. The magnetic eyeliner was easy to apply and dried in less than 15 seconds. Once in place, the lashes stayed strong and secure without falling off (although we could adjust them easily). We did feel like the inner and outer corners of our eyes were a bit itchy, although we wonder if that would have been solved by cutting the ends a little bit more. They were comfortable to wear, but we could still tell we were wearing them—so they didn’t feel 100 percent natural.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text><a href=#>Static Nails Soft Glam Magnetic Eyelashes</a></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We had a difficult time applying these magnetic lashes. The magnetic gel liner was “quite clumpy and very sticky,” according to our tester, who also felt like the liner made her eyelids stick together. That messiness extended to removing the liner, too; it took us a few different products and some gentle massaging to get every trace of the liner off our lids. However, once they were on, the attachment on these magnetic lashes was super secure and the lashes felt light and airy—we felt like we could wear them for hours without thinking about it.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-our-testing-process></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Our Testing Process</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To start, we spent about a week researching the top-rated magnetic lashes on the market. After homing in on online ratings, we spent 24 hours putting the 16 most popular magnetic lashes to the test. We had eight testers try the products so that they could analyze the performance of each and write down their insights during the process. In doing so, our testers rated every set on a scale of 1 to 5 in four key categories: ease of application, feel, overall look, and ease of removal. Once the data was collected, we were able to narrow down the original pool of products to the eight best magnetic lashes.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Material</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The material of magnetic lashes is an important factor to consider as it will determine how natural the falsies look as well as how durable they are. Most magnetic lashes are made out of synthetic fibers, silk, or faux mink. Silk and faux mink tend to look the most realistic, so they are a great option if you are seeking a natural look. You should also be on the lookout for lashes that are waterproof or offer resistance against wind and other elements for better hold.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Application</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Magnetic lashes can typically be applied one of two ways; with a magnetic eyeliner or by sandwiching your real lashes in between two strips of magnetic lashes. Both methods use magnetization to adhere the lashes and are way less messy than using typical lash glue, not to mention more gentle on the eyelid. The eyeliner method is definitely easier to master, but if you don’t like the look of eyeliner you may want to try the second method. It really comes down to personal preference and how much patience you have.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Size and Style</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The size and the style you choose will depend on your unique eye shape and your preference. Magnetic lashes can come in a variety of different lengths ranging from short, medium, and long as well as styles like wispy, full, and dense. Certain styles or lengths can definitely accent specific eye shapes better than others. For example, a cat eye-styled lash or a longer lash can open hooded eyes up more while a shorter, wispy lash with a bit of a curl can be more accentuating for round eyes. It really comes down to personal preference, your lash goals, and what feels most comfortable for you, though. A kit with a variety of lash styles and lengths is the best way to go if you are not sure which style will work best for your eyes.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Why use magnetic lashes over regular falsies?&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re deciding between regular lashes or magnetic ones, there are many benefits to the latter that might seal the deal for you.&nbsp; "If you like traditional lashes, you're going to love magnetic lashes because they are quick, easy, and no mess when you're in a rush," celebrity makeup artist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Alexx Mayo</a> says of the alternative.

Then apply tiny strokes across your lid, starting at the inner corner of your lash line, keeping in mind to match the thickness of the liner to the band size of your chosen fake eyelashes. Celebrity makeup artist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nocaes>Joanna Simkin</a> adds, "try holding a mirror under your face and looking down to give you a lot more eye area to drop the lash in from." She also suggests using a tweezer or lash applicator instead of your fingers for more precision and control. It's important to note that you shouldn't apply mascara to the magnetic lashes once they're applied, as doing so will damage the strands and shorten their lifespan.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you remove magnetic lashes?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes time to remove your magnetic lashes, always be gentle. "I like to use <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>micellar water</a> on a cotton swab and just lightly wipe the magnetic tabs,” Simkin says. Once the lash is off, it’s best to clean and sanitize the bands with alcohol and store them in the case that they came in. This way, they are ready for the next use and free of any leftover makeup, dirt, or oil.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Former Real Simple beauty editor <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Anneke Knot</a> is currently a full-time freelancer based in San Francisco.
