From near crashes on a plane to being hit in the head, Meat Loaf managed to escape death for decades before his passing in January 2022.</strong></p><p>The <a href=#>music</a> legend referred to himself as a “cat with 48 lives”, because of his ‘near misses’ when it came to fate. He felt he “should have died” multiple times, but somehow managed to come through the other side. We take a look at the <a href=#>celebrity</a> hitmaker’s brush with death before Meat Loaf tragically passed when his health took a turn for the worst.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meat-loaf-escaped-death-he-was-like-a-cat>Meat Loaf escaped death – he was like a ‘cat’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/GettyImages-1213209132-1024x681.jpg><p>He <a href=# rel=nofollow>told</a> The Telegraph he was a “cat with 48 lives”, because he survived falling “three stories” and crashes.</p><p>In 2013, he detailed some of the wild stories to Ultimate Classic Rock. He explained, throughout his life, he suffered 18 concussions and eight car crashes. But that didn’t stop him. Meat Loaf even explained he had close calls while flying on planes, although, didn’t go into further detail on what happened during those times.</p><p>When in high school, he says a shot put champion fired a 12-pound shot which ended up colliding with his head. He claimed it flew 62 feet in the air before denting his cranium.</p><p>But he joked that it “didn’t even knock me out” and believes it improved his voice. He <a href=# rel=nofollow>told</a> Rolling Stone a few years later that he felt the skull bash instantly made him the singer we all knew and loved. Apparently, he couldn’t “carry a tune” but then had a “three-and-a-half octave vocal range” after the accident.</p><p>In the 1970s, he shattered his leg after jumping off the stage. As a fan of theatrical performances, it would inevitably put a strain on his health.</p><p>10 years ago, the star had heart surgery after collapsing during a concert. But it wasn’t the first time. Suffering from asthma, he fell during another gig in 2016 which was <a href=# rel=nofollow>reported</a> to be due to dehydration. However, later that year, Meat Loaf said he had emergency surgery on his back. Telling the Press Association, he needed a “spinal fusion” because of a cyst that pinched the nerves.</p><p>He also collapsed during performances in 2011 in Pittsburgh and 2003 as well, in London.</p><p>Then in 2019, three years before Meat Loaf’s death, he tripped and fell during a Q&A session. The fall caused his collarbone to break. He was in hospital for 42 days, after his neck and shoulder were also injured.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meat-loaf-s-health-condition>Meat Loaf’s health condition</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>9/27/47 <a href=#>#MeatLoaf</a><a href=#>#HappyBirthday</a> to the late Meat Loaf, he would have been 76 today.</p><p>Michael Lee Aday (born Marvin Lee Aday), known professionally as Meat Loaf, was an American rock singer and actor known for his powerful, wide-ranging voice and theatrical live shows. He is on… <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/amOj7oEB6t</a></p>— RockNRollNationLive (@RnRNationlive) <a href=#>September 27, 2023</a></figure><p>View Tweet</p><p>After collapsing during his 2003 show in London, the star was diagnosed with Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome.</p><p>He told Rolling Stone: “Many people are born with this condition and can live their whole lives without ever knowing it is there.</p><p>“Mine appeared to have been quiet until now. The prognosis is excellent, as the procedure’s success rate is over 95 percent.”</p><p>The syndrome affects the movement of electrical signals through the heart. It can lead to a fast heartbeat and other arrhythmia.</p><p>Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome is present at birth, but <a href=# rel=nofollow>symptoms</a> may not arise until people are much older. Doctors are still unsure why the extra electrical connection takes place, and its cause is unknown. However, with treatment, those diagnosed are expected to live a full and normal life.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-it-put-me-back-to-zero>‘It put me back to zero’</h2><p>Meat Loaf was on the mend before his death. Despite the ailments and falls he suffered, he was working back to his old self.</p><p>However, when Covid struck, it ‘put him back to zero’.</p><p>At the time, he <a href=# rel=nofollow>told</a> the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette: “I had eight shows booked in the U.K., and I felt really strong about being able to do them.</p><p>“COVID hit. I lost my PT, and all this strength in my back muscles just left, and I was worse off than before.”</p><p>“I was in the gym for 2½ hours on days off, and these guys would walk in, they were fit-looking, I could beat them on any machine they wanted, but that wasn’t the goal. The goal was just to stay fit and be able to do my show,” he said.</p><p>“My whole life was spent in football and then in shows and gyms, and when you’ve done something and then stop it, you deteriorate that much faster.”</p><p>Besides the <a href=#>health</a> difficulties, he also struggled with mental health. The star, who featured in <a href=#>Hollywood</a> films like Fight Club, turned to alcohol. He said he struggled with drink for almost a year during an emotional breakdown.</p><p>But Meat Loaf also found it hard to deal with fame. He stepped away from the spotlight a year after his breakout album, released in 1977. Bat Out Of Hell skyrocketed his success, but he “didn’t want the responsibility” after trying to come to terms with fame.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meat-loaf-s-death-rocked-fans>Meat Loaf’s death rocked fans</h2><p>Meat Loaf’s death shocked fans across the globe. The star passed away on January 20, 2022, in Nashville, Tennessee, at age 74. Real name Michael Lee Aday, he became one of the bestselling musicians of all time. He also was an actor, starring in beloved <a href=#>movies</a> like Rocky Horror Picture Show. He had a whopping 50 credits to his name.</p><p>TMZ <a href=# rel=nofollow>reported</a> at the time that the star fell “seriously ill” with Covid. His representatives and family never confirmed nor denied the reports after he passed away.</p><p>On the first anniversary of his death this year, Meat Loaf’s daughters paid tribute to the star.</p><p>Pearl and Amanda Aday, wrote on <a href=#>Instagram</a>: “Today marks one year since we had to say goodbye to our dad for the final time.</p><p>“To honor Dad and you, his global community of friends and fans, we want to share with you a short film we put together with our great friend and brilliant filmmaker, Jack Bennett.”</p><p>They <a href=# rel=nofollow>added</a>: “This is a celebration of Dad’s life and legacy, an acknowledgment of the man he was on and off the stage. Not just the performer, but the boss, the mentor, the friend, the husband, the godfather, the grandpa ‘Papa Meat,’ and the father.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlxX2eEcLnEmqtmpJ%2BWs26x0pyYqZ2UYrGmrdOhZK2goqTCqLTOrqtmoJmoeq21xZ5km52WpL%2BmecWipZqkXam%2ForPEnbBmq6SnwqS3jg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./melanie-lawson-bio-net-worth-married-husband-height.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Melanie Lawson Bio, Net Worth, Married, Husband, Height</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./malaysian-farmers-have-finally-discovered-how-grow-prized.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Malaysian farmers have finally discovered how to grow prized Japanese muskmelons, regarded as art</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amal-clooney-mob-wife-trend-cream-fur-coat.html>Amal Clooney Elevates the Mob Wife Trend in a Cream Fur Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./demolition-underway-at-washington-elementary-davenport.html>Demolition underway at Washington Elementary, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iowa-man-killed-in-head-on-crash.html>Iowa man killed in head-on crash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./style-edit-richard-milles-technically-ambitious-new-rm-30-01-automatic-luxury-watch-was-inspired.html>Style Edit: Richard Milles technically ambitious new RM 30-01 Automatic luxury watch was inspired</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./463481-what-happened-frankie-lons-life-story-death.html>What happened to Frankie Lons?
