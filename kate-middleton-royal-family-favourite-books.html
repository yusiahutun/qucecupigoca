On World Book Day 2018, she wrote: "Whether it was the dashing Scarlet Pimpernel escaping the French Revolutionaries, the inquisitive Alice in the madness of Wonderland or Dickens' Oliver Twist asking bravely for a second helping in the workhouse, my father's reading brought them vividly to life."</p><p id=e7MLn6LVYObP data-wc=1><strong>MORE: </strong><a class=hm-link href=#>4 times the Queen has addressed the nation in times of crisis</a></p><p id=eM_zUR3QqMrW data-wc=62>She's sure children (both little and big) will be thrilled with David Walliams's as well as , and .

Of the pleasure he takes in great writing, Charles says: "I have always loved the way you can twist or turn a word to shade it with a different meaning and I marvel at how great writers use so few words to evoke a feeling, a sense of place or the depths of a character."</p><h2>Queen Letizia of Spain</h2><p id=e7FRMX8mEmCP data-wc=48>Across the Channel, Queen Letizia of Spain is also an avid bookworm. In their engagement interview, Letizia said she'd fallen for her husband King Felipe because he's "a great reader".

Now, as Queen of Belgium, the former speech therapist is encouraging families to spend their time in self-isolation reading and keeping journals about their feelings. Asked about the books that have changed her life, she chose Helen Keller's autobiography and by Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt, about a ten-year-old boy with terminal cancer whose parents refuse to discuss his impending death.
