Gender dysphoria is defined as the distress caused by a discrepancy between a person's gender identity and the one assigned to them at birth.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Overall, the analysis found that at least 121,882 children ages 6 to 17 were diagnosed with gender dysphoria from 2017 through 2021. Reuters found similar trends when it requested state-level data on diagnoses among children covered by Medicaid, the public insurance program for lower-income families.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Gender-affirming care covers a spectrum of interventions. It can entail adopting a child's preferred name and pronouns and letting them dress in alignment with their gender identity — called social transitioning.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It can incorporate therapy or other forms of psychological treatment. And, from around the start of adolescence, it can include medical interventions such as puberty blockers, hormones and, in some cases, surgery. In all of it, the aim is to support and affirm the child's gender identity.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>These medical treatments don't begin until the onset of puberty, typically around age 10 or 11.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But families that go the medical route venture onto uncertain ground, where science has yet to catch up with practice. While the number of gender clinics treating children in the US has grown from zero to more than 100 in the past 15 years — and waiting lists are long — strong evidence of the efficacy and possible long-term consequences of that treatment remains scant.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Puberty blockers and sex hormones do not have US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for children's gender care. No clinical trials have established their safety for such off-label use.
