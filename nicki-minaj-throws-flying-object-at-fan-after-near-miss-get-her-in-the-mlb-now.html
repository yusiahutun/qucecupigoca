That’s right, she threw it straight back</strong> <strong>into the crowd.</strong></p><p>It has unfortunately become common for <a href=#>music</a> stars to have things thrown at them on stage during their concerts recently. The ‘trend’ has even seen singer Bebe Rexha hit in the face with an iPhone, as Harry Styles has also fallen victim. <a href=#>Adele had even warned concertgoers</a> not to partake in the dangerous trend, but it looks like it’s still ongoing. Well, not if Nicki Minaj has anything to do with it.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/04/GettyImages-2053270153-751x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-nicki-minaj-throws-object-back-at-fan-after-near-miss>Nicki Minaj throws object back at fan after near miss</h2><p>The Spaceships singer almost became the latest victim of being ‘attacked’ by a flying object, but luckily she had fast reflexes as she moved it with her hand.</p><p>It seemed to be a bracelet flying in the air, which the 41-year-old ran back to pick up, and yep, you guessed it, threw it right back in the crowd. With some force, may we add.</p><p>The ‘incident’ happened while the <a href=#>music</a> star was performing her 2012 hit single, Starships at Little Caesars Arena in Detroit.</p><p>Of course, the video is now going viral on X, formerly known as <a href=#>Twitter</a>, and fans couldn’t believe how good her throw was.</p><p>“THE BASEBALL PITCH!!” exclaimed one fan of her ‘dramatic’ throw.</p><p>“Get Nicki Minaj in the MLB now! That throw is [fire emoji]” joked another.</p><p>Another comment read: “That windup is INSANE where did you learn how to throw like that mama???”</p><p>It’s not the first time this year there’s been some ‘drama’ at Nicki’s show. Last month, a video went viral of her <a href=#>‘snatching’ the mic off a fan</a> after their ‘terrible rendition’ of one of her hit songs. However, it looks like it was only a joke, and she ‘performs’ this at several concerts.</p><p>Phew!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-drake-supports-the-singer-at-her-toronto-show>Drake supports the singer at her Toronto show</h2><p>Never a dull moment at a Nicki show, at her Toronto show last week, <a href=#>Drake</a> could be seen in the stands. The star even gave him a shoutout while performing their latest collaboration Needle. However, she revealed he wouldn’t be joining her on stage.</p><p>We can’t blame him as he’s just come off his mammoth, It’s All A Blur tour around North America. He’s also been involved in some ‘beef’ with fellow rappers lately, with diss tracks dropping left right, and center.</p><p>As a picture of him at Minaj’s show circulated the internet, fans claimed he <a href=#>looked like he’d aged</a>, as some said the “rap beef had him stressed.”</p><p>We wouldn’t be surprised if it did!</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlsX2d%2FcLrInKKiZZ2eu6K2jK2fq6enqHqnuNiipaBln5e3pq%2FTZpitZZaWu26txa2cq2Wemq6zecyiqqxll5rBbrTEq2Sipl2ptaZ5zKWZZqafrHw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./playboy-model-joy-corrigan-reveals-lying-age-decades-really-35-not-28-ashamed-age-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Playboy model Joy Corrigan reveals she has been LYING about her age for decades and is really 35 and</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./courtney-roker.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Courtney Roker</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amal-clooney-mob-wife-trend-cream-fur-coat.html>Amal Clooney Elevates the Mob Wife Trend in a Cream Fur Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./demolition-underway-at-washington-elementary-davenport.html>Demolition underway at Washington Elementary, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iowa-man-killed-in-head-on-crash.html>Iowa man killed in head-on crash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./style-edit-richard-milles-technically-ambitious-new-rm-30-01-automatic-luxury-watch-was-inspired.html>Style Edit: Richard Milles technically ambitious new RM 30-01 Automatic luxury watch was inspired</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./463481-what-happened-frankie-lons-life-story-death.html>What happened to Frankie Lons?
