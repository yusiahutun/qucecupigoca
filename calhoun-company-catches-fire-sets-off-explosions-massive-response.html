Firefighters from Jasper County, Smith County and Forrest County also turned up in their turnout gear to assist.</p><p>Smoke was billowing from all around the 27,000-square-foot building at Highway 84 West and Meador Road and flames were on the rear east side of the building when the first firefighters arrived. They had to use power tools to access the inside of the building and mount an aggressive interior attack.</p><p>It was noted that there were large amounts of kerosene, tannerite, propane, fertilizer and new shipments of ammunition, among other explosives in the building. One propane tank exploded shortly after firefighters got inside, but no one was injured by it. They soon had to get out of the building, though, because fire breached the roof, making the structure unsafe to stay in.</p><p>They were trying to keep the flames from spreading to the northwest corner of the store, where the ammo was located, but since they were having to fight the fire from outside, it eventually ignited. Nearly two hours after the first firefighters arrived, ammunition began detonating and that and other explosions were heard consistently for about an hour. Rivets on the metal building became heated and popped off like fireworks, keeping first-responders on edge.</p><p>Spectators at a West Jones High School football game — nearly three miles away — reported hearing an explosion in the distance during the game. There were plenty of spectators surrounding the drama unfolding at Farm Systems during and after the game, too.</p><p>Highway 84 West, between Highway 28 and Flynt Road, was shut down for several hours as the area was saturated with emergency personnel, vehicles and equipment.</p><p>“All firefighters did an excellent job at this very complex scene,” said Dana Bumgardner, spokeswoman for the Jones County Fire Council. “The Jones County Fire Council greatly appreciates each firefighter and all those who assisted with mutual aid.”</p><p>EMServ Ambulance Service medics treated three people at the scene — two of whom were firefighters — for what were described as minor injuries.</p><p>Volunteers from Calhoun, Soso, Sharon, Hebron, Pleasant Ridge, Shady Grove, Sandersville, Powers, Rustin, Moselle, Ovett, M&M, Glade and Johnson responded along with the EFD and LFD and Jones County Beat 2 personnel with heavy equipment. Firefighters from Mossville and Stringer in Jasper County as well as several from Smith and Forrest counties also came to help.</p><p>“This is the largest response by Jones County volunteers in recent memory,” said Lance Chancellor of Powers VFD.</p><p>The Laurel Police Department assisted with traffic control as did the Jones County Sheriff’s Department and Mississippi Highway Patrol. The building sustained major damage and emergency personnel were on the scene for seven hours. The cause of the fire was under investigation.</p><p>The parent company of Farm Systems Inc is J & R Lumber and Supply out of Alabama, the general manager said, but he declined comment. The Jones County store opened in August 2021.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKaVrMBwstGenJimlazAcK%2FApZ%2BorZ5isLC5z5qlsmWTlsGktMSsZJ%2Bhopp6tLHTrGSonpZisrm8y6iqoqeeqHqurdKsoK%2BdXaeytLzOp6qeZ5Gnwaqvy56WcZpmmH15sZNmbW1wYGJ%2BcrHEZnBvapNigKN%2FxWucaW%2BVl4OmesetpKU%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./summer-maxi-skirts-under-40-amazon-7504825.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Hilary Duff Wore the Perfect Maxi Skirt, and I Found 8 Similar Styles</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./new-zealand-actor-sam-neill-s-married-twice-is-in-a-longtime-relationship-with-wife-noriko-watanabe-has-two-children.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>New Zealand Actor Sam Neill's Married Twice And Currently Dating Someone At Present; Details On His</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amal-clooney-mob-wife-trend-cream-fur-coat.html>Amal Clooney Elevates the Mob Wife Trend in a Cream Fur Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./demolition-underway-at-washington-elementary-davenport.html>Demolition underway at Washington Elementary, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iowa-man-killed-in-head-on-crash.html>Iowa man killed in head-on crash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./style-edit-richard-milles-technically-ambitious-new-rm-30-01-automatic-luxury-watch-was-inspired.html>Style Edit: Richard Milles technically ambitious new RM 30-01 Automatic luxury watch was inspired</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./463481-what-happened-frankie-lons-life-story-death.html>What happened to Frankie Lons?
