For most of my life — kindergarten to 12th grade, to be exact — I wore a uniform. And while the plaid skirts and school crests changed over the years, one thing stayed the same: The ballet flats. Whether I was sprinting for the bus, running around the schoolyard at lunch, or anxiously tapping my foot during a math exam, the plain, dainty shoes hugged my feet everywhere I went.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After high school graduation, I swore them off. But, sure enough, years later, they’re back in my rotation. I’m not sure if my sudden interest in them sparked because they’re trendy again (thank you, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>balletcore</a>) or because I needed a casual yet elegant pair of shoes to wear to work, but either way, I’m surprisingly not mad about it.&nbsp; Ballet flats have come a long way. What used to be a boring flat shoe is now updated with a bunch of modern shapes (I’m partial to the square-toe shape), fresh styles, bold colors, and unexpected textures.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Because there’s enough choices that can easily make your head spin, I researched and tested the best ballet flats on the market. Then, I chatted with stylists to compile a list of flats that are nothing like the ones I wore in high school. With its butter-soft Italian leather, modernized shape, and reasonable price tag, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Everlane’s Italian Leather Day Ballet Flat</a> won our Best Overall spot.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Read on for the best ballet flats.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-everlane-italian-leather-day-ballet-flat></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Everlane Italian Leather Day Ballet Flat</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Everlane The Italian Leather Day Ballet Flat " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/pkaLI8Y5UAZF9GVQmxZ2TWIwuYo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/everlane-the-italian-leather-day-ballet-flat-ac98707808ca4ea2aa6412e02035fca1.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Everlane&nbsp;</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=2><p>The leather stretches a bit after wear, so if you’re in between sizes, it might be better to size down to ensure a better fit.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We hold our “best overall” shoes to a pretty high standard — not only do they need to be chic and versatile, but they also must be comfortable. And these Everlane flats are just that. With the subtle square-toe, they echo a timeless and elegant vibe without looking as though they came straight from your grandmother’s closet. The shoe comes in seven shades, including a mix of gem tones and a classic pale pink ballerina color that resembles a pointe shoe.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Thanks to a cushioned insole and the smooth, flexible leather, you can expect the shoe to hug each foot like a glove. I wore a pair (which was kindly gifted to me by the brand) to work on a 90-degree day in New York City. High humidity and scorching heat are generally a recipe for sweat — and therefore, chafing — but with these on my feet, I felt like I wasn’t wearing any shoes at all. In fact, the flats took me from the subway to the office to a fancy dinner, sans rubbing or blistering. The material moves with you (they’re leather, it’s inevitable), but not to the point where they feel like they’re going to slip right off of your feet. Whether you wear them with a trouser and a tee, a flowy dress, or a blazer with jeans, you’ll question why you didn’t purchase a pair sooner. Note: If you’re in between sizes, I recommend sizing down, just to be safe, because they do stretch.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish:</strong>&nbsp;<strong>$140</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Leather | <strong>Sizes: </strong>5 to 11 | <strong>Number of Colors:&nbsp;</strong>7</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Joy Kim</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-value-amazon-essentials-womens-pointed-toe-ballet-flat></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Value</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Amazon Essentials Women's Pointed-Toe Ballet Flat</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Essentials Women's Ballet Flat" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/yeULsP9TYhZj9CSoUIs34NZiQA4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/127-37fc9150c78143b5bd8c5d22ec48a319.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This pair from Amazon Essentials proves that ballet flats don’t have to be expensive to be comfortable (or good-looking). For just over $20, you can take your pick between 20 different color ways, including staple shades like black, brown and beige, as well as poppier options like leopard print, suede and patent leather. The shoes were designed with comfort in mind — they come with “heel-pillow” technology (aka lots of interior padding) that ensures your feet feel their best, even if you’re standing for most of the day.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Thanks to the non-abrasive faux-leather, the shoes won’t leave you covered in battle scars after your first wear. Yes, the shoes are made from faux leather and have rubber soles, so they’re not as luxurious as other pairs on this list, but when you consider the price point, they’re a steal. Some reviews say to size up, but we recommend sticking to your regular size as the material will give after wearing a few times. Most shoes only go up to a size 12, but these go up to a 15 (which is pretty rare), ensuring you’ll have no problem finding the perfect fit.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish:</strong>&nbsp;<strong>$23</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Polyurethane, Rubber | <strong>Sizes: </strong>5 to 15<strong> </strong>| <strong>Number of Colors: </strong>20</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-square-toe-mansur-gavriel-square-toe-ballerina></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Square Toe</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Mansur Gavriel Square Toe Ballerina</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=778 data-sizes=750px alt="Mansur Gavriel" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/yWZGAMQJr2nRfnmKd7A2UIqUCaE=/fit-in/1500x778/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Screenshot2023-05-16at9.52.33AM-36653e24bfe74b988d37c32230ce699d.png"> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=2><p>High-quality leather, intricate stitching, and a thoughtful design set these designer ballet flats apart from the rest.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re going to splurge on a pair of ballet flats, let it be for these.

This slightly heeled pair (one-inch, to be exact) doesn't lean on logomania to get the point that these are designer across. The classic horsebit detail on the front signals Gucci because the recognizable detail instantly brings you back to their loafers, which we've raved about before, regardless that you can't see a Gucci logo anywhere obvious on the show. We also appreciate the hybrid toe that looks partially square and partially rounded, giving you the best of both worlds — but we imagine it might feel a bit snug on larger feet. However, just like the loafers, the leather will also mold to your foot with time, giving you a comfortable fit with time. You can't go wrong with the black, but it also comes in cream and ivory for a summer flair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish:</strong>&nbsp;<strong>$890</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Goat leather | <strong>Sizes: </strong>IT34-IT42 | <strong>Colors</strong>: 3<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-rounded-toe-jcrew-zoe-ballet-flats></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Rounded Toe</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>J.Crew Zoe Ballet Flats</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=2000 data-sizes=750px alt=J.Crew style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/pKBOzHApYijWC6q38JT7BH8YjZ4=/fit-in/1500x2000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/AY953_BK0001-02b2f81786924d72b83f6e7de58eb6d0.jpeg"> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For a simple pair of ballet flats, Zoe Ballet Flats from J.Crew are your best bet. The reasonably-priced shoe offers the classic design you know and love (translation: there’s no extra bells and whistles), but with a slightly modern twist. I like to think of the shoe (which the brand kindly gifted me) as the refined older sister of the ballet flats you wore in middle school — thanks to the softer sole and additional toe coverage, they look a touch more sophisticated but include the same dainty bow detail you’re used to.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">They come in plain and textured leather, both of which are canvas-lined to limit slipping and sliding on warmer days. The more you wear them, the more they mold to your feet in a chic I’ve-had-these-for-years type of way. They run true to size, but some say they can be snug if you have a wider foot. If that’s the case, you might want to try sizing up a half size. If you need a little extra support, skip these and go with a pair that has built-in cushioning.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Leather or Suede<strong> </strong>| <strong>Sizes: </strong>5 to 12 | <strong>Number of Colors:&nbsp;</strong>7</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-pointed-toe-anine-bing-delphine-flats></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Pointed Toe</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Anine Bing Delphine Flats</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Anine Bing Delphine Flats" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/WS445WJT29ik6pj1Vbo6L0i03Mk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/129-11c710f632194e17a5ec6edf1c2c91d0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Anine Bing</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Perfect for a minimalist or someone who appreciates sleek designs, the Anine Bing Delphine Flats offer a contemporary look with a classic, comfortable fit. With its smooth black cow leather exterior paired with black grosgrain trim (a weaved, corded fabric) and a black insole, these pointed-toe flats look clean and sophisticated, even when they’re sitting in your closet. While wearing the flats (which I was kindly gifted by the brand), I was able to quickly gather that they’re more structured than other options on this list.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The leather isn’t as malleable, so it doesn’t stretch out as much as some of the other shoes. And, in true Anine Bing fashion, the shoes feature a small gold-tone hardware monogram at the heel. I personally loved the added detail, but if you’re not into it, don’t worry — it’s barely noticeable. I love these so much (especially for dressing up casual ‘fits for the office), so I wish they came in other colors besides black.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish:</strong>&nbsp;<strong>$350</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Cow leather<strong> </strong>| <strong>Sizes: </strong>6 to 11 | <strong>Number of Colors:&nbsp;</strong>1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-with-strap-loeffler-randall-leonie-ballet-ballet-flat></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best With Strap</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Loeffler Randall Leonie Ballet Ballet Flat</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1875 data-sizes=750px alt="Leonie Ballet Ballet Flat" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/_pfWBLFw4rEx0W3kz_punmtI04c=/fit-in/1500x1875/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/LEONIE-GLCF-BALET_1_1500x-46b5ae9f66e74083bb4d18666dd2ecfe.jpg"> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We've long admired Loeffler Randall's shoes. The feminine, whimsical designs catch our eye every time. And while we love the ruffled and pleated shoes the brand is most known for, we have our eyes on the classic ballet flats, which elevate the timeless shoe with a subtle elastic strap that matches the leather. We don't think these will work well for wider feet, as the elastic prevents the shoe from stretching out too much, but we appreciate that it adds a little extra security to the delicate shoe that feels weightless. The already soft leather will hug your foot and become more comfortable with time. Pick between a soft leather, raffia texture, or a bedazzled mesh in neutral shades and subtle pastels to add to your wardrobe.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish:</strong>&nbsp;<strong>$250</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Leather, elastic | <strong>Sizes: </strong>5-12 | <strong>Colors</strong>: 16</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-slingback-sarah-flint-natalie-sling></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Slingback</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Sarah Flint Natalie Sling</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sarah Flint Natalie Sling" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/6ss4OoAhatvmmk-yoK-vb8IBsdw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/130-d5753140ebe6424e86c9d898ec63b5c4.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sarah Flint</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=2><p>Interior padding, a rubber forepart, and hidden elastics are just some of the thoughtful details that make these elevated slingback flats so special.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Whether you’re not ready to add a ballet flat back into your collection, or simply want to add another (more glamorous) style to your existing rotation, a slingback is a great option to consider. Sarah Flint offers a style that takes the classic flat up a notch: The Natalie Sling. According to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Sarah Flint</a>, the mastermind behind her eponymous brand, the Natalie Sling is a cool, vintage take on the original <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Natalie</a> (one of the brand’s most beloved styles).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Made in the same family-owned factories as the original, the sling has an easier, more ready-to-wear fit,” she explains. “It also reaches back visually to the 40s and 50s, when exposed heels and ankles were seen as a transgressive assertion of femininity.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With lots of interior padding, a rubber forepart to prevent slipping, and a hidden elastic behind the functional buckle, the tasteful slingback was thoughtfully crafted with comfort top of mind. But, with details like an asymmetrical bow and stylish leather outsole, the shoes are nothing short of polished perfection. Shades like Petal (a light beige) and Espresso Croc Embossed Calf (a brown crocodile) are always available, but be sure to check back from time to time as there are often limited edition drops added to the lineup.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish:</strong>&nbsp;<strong>$450</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Leather, Gold (Buckle)<strong> </strong>| <strong>Sizes: </strong>4 to 13<strong> </strong>| <strong>Number of Colors: </strong>3</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Joy Kim</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-heel-ballarette-aventino-leather-ballet-flats-with-heel></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Heel</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Ballarette Aventino Leather Ballet Flats with Heel</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Ballarette Aventino Leather Ballet Flats with Heel" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/8-ZHfhfKi6bet_8WpkPuzEii9PI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/131-cd7ecd278cd948718519ae93fba279b0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ballarette</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Breaking into the US shoe scene is Ballarette, an Italian footwear brand founded by two Roman women. Similar to some other options on this list like Everlane and Sarah Flint, the Ballerette shoes are handmade in Italy.&nbsp; What makes these different is that they’re sold in the brand’s nine stores, each in a major Italian city. Having recently expanded to online sales in the US, the brand gifted me a pair of their bestselling heeled ballet flats to try. Spoiler alert: You should get your hands on a pair fast.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Aventino shoe is basically a cross between a traditional ballet flat and the block heel from your favorite four inch pumps. Not only are the shoes adorable, but they’re supportive, too, thanks to a tender leather insole and adjustable front bow that can be tightened to make the shoes fit better. You also don’t have to worry about them being too high — the heel is a little over an inch and a half foot high. In my opinion, these are especially great for someone who doesn’t like wearing flats but wants to get in on the trend in their own way. Simply take your pick between 15 different colors — it’s hard, I know — and wait for the compliments to come rolling in.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Leather | <strong>Sizes: </strong>4.5 to 11.5<strong> </strong>&nbsp;| <strong>Number of</strong> <strong>Colors</strong>: 15</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-sustainable-rothys-the-flat></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Sustainable</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Rothy’s The Flat</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Rothy&amp;acirc;s The Flat" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Cb6oheC1gTWOmZTTrzy1BMHjIQw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Rothys-The-Flat-eb2a88ce8edd47dd80a8022b0261148c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Rothy's</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There’s a reason Rothy’s has such a cult following: Their sustainable shoes don’t require breaking in and are as comfy as they come. They’re knitted from recycled plastic (11 plastic bottles to be exact) and feel soft, flexible, and aren’t blister-inducing.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One detail I especially love about these shoes is that they’re machine washable. Life happens, so even if you spill coffee on yourself or step in something questionable, you can just pop these flats in the wash and after a few minutes on a gentle cycle, they’re good as new.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Despite the knitted material, they don’t stretch much, so the brand recommends sizing up a half size for narrow feet and a full size for wider feet for the best possible fit.There’s upwards of 30 (yes, 30) designs and colors to choose from, so for most people, there’s something for everyone. Something to note: These don’t offer a ton of arch support, so if you need extra help in that area, you should check out a pair on this list that aren’t as flat (like the Amazon Essentials Ballet Flats).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish:</strong>&nbsp;<strong>$129</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Plastic bottles | <strong>Sizes: </strong>5-13 | <strong>Number of</strong> <strong>Colors</strong>: 31</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-our-testing-process></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Our Testing Process</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For this story, Caitlyn Martyn searched high and low for all the top ballet flats on the market right now. She then tested seven of ten pairs in order to determine if they felt comfortable to walk in, especially when on her feet all day, looked stylish, and felt worth the price. After testing a dozen pairs and researching worthwhile pairs, according to reviews and other editor recommendations, she landed on these eight, which hit each point on the checklist.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Fit<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As with most shoes, it’s important to pay attention to the sizing chart. Every pair of shoes is made differently, so even if you’re normally a certain size, you might be better off sizing up or down depending on the intended fit. It’s also key to keep in mind that when purchasing shoes made in other countries, the sizes are different. If you need help determining which size is right for you, check out an international conversion chart that breaks down the different sizes.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Style<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Ballet flats come in a variety of styles, each with a different toe shape — rounded, pointed, and squared. A rounded toe, like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">J.Crew Zoe Ballet Flats</a>, are the quintessential style that comes to mind when you think of ballet flats. A pointed toe, like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Anine Bing Delphine Flats</a>, are exactly how they sound; they’re ballet flats that form a triangle-shape at the foot and end in a point at the toes. And finally, square toe ballet flats, which are the most similar to an actual ballet pointe shoe, have a flat, straight edge along the tip of the shoe.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“My favorite style is the square toe — it’s more visually interesting and effortlessly edgy,” Stuart says. Stylist and trend forecaster <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Kendall Becker</a> agrees. “Opting for a square toe ballet flat in an exciting color looks elevated and fresh,” she adds. The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Mansur Gavriel Square Toe Ballerina</a>, for example, comes in a variety of colors — like sky blue or light pink. “If you’re not one to dress in a head-turning hue everyday, a pop of color through an accessory like shoes is the perfect way to add a flair to a minimalist outfit,” she says.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Material&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">According to Becker, leather is the leader here. Not only does the material look more luxe, but it makes for a comfortable fit almost immediately. The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Everlane Italian Leather Day Ballet Flat</a>, our Best Overall, is made from Italian leather that fits like a glove from the moment you put a shoe on — no breaking in required.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">On the other hand, mixed media options like satin, mesh, tweed or a textured material (like the plastic bottle material that makes up <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Rothy’s The Point</a>) ground an outfit and give it an unexpected twist. If you’re not sure which to choose, Stuart recommends assessing what occasion you’ll be wearing them for. “If you’re looking for an everyday flat you can wear for work and on the weekends, your best bet is going to be leather as it’s super easy to remove dirt, grime and other stains,” she explains. “If you’re seeking a statement flat or something for special occasions, consider a satin option — the material has a natural shine and automatically makes any outfit look dressed up.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How can you style ballet flats?&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Ballet flats are wardrobe staple — they’re timeless, effortless, and pair well with a lot of the clothes you probably already have in your closet. While they work well with a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>blazer</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>white t-shirt</a>, and pair of jeans, they’re equally as stylish with classic ballet pieces like tights, leg warmers, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>slip dresses</a>. “To make a ballet flat look more edgy, pair them with black or leather shorts and ripped stockings,” says Stuart. “It’s easy to cross into ‘stuffy office attire’ territory, so stay away from pairing your ballet flats with mini skirts and head-to-toe suitin,” warns Becker.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How can you tell if ballet flats are high quality?<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When searching for quality flats, it’s all about the soles of the shoes. “The sole determines how much you can actually wear the shoe,” Stuart says. “You always want to ensure that the insoles are either leather or rubber since they mold to your feet.” Leather soles are initially hard, but when worn over time, create a cushion for your foot. Rubber soles, on the other hand, are immediately comfortable and require little to no break-in time but typically get more uncomfortable as you wear them due to the synthetic lining. “For an everyday, functional ballet flat, a leather sole is your best option, but for an occasion shoe, the rubber sole is best,” she explains.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Why are ballet flats so popular?<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">According to Becker, ballet flats are one of fashion’s responses to the new way we dress. “We all got used to a work-from-home wardrobe during the pandemic. And, as much as we’re ready to dress up again, we’re still craving comfort,” she explains. Flint agrees, sharing that ballet flats are perfect for those who want to dress up again without sacrificing comfort and ease. “Ballet flats combine femininity and function,” she says. “They are comfortable to walk in, but look polished, elegant, and appropriate for almost any setting.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Caitlyn Martyn</a>&nbsp;is an experienced writer in the beauty and fashion industry.
