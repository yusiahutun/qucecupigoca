I just got lost in it,” McCormick began. “But on graduation day 2019, I was in a bad car accident. The car caught on fire. I had to learn how to walk and talk again.”</p><p>“I got a phone call. I thought it was just a fender bender. But when I got there, it was terrifying,” McCormick’s mother, Teshauna, who accompanied her son to his audition, shared. “I really don’t know where I’d be if he hadn’t made it.”</p><p>McCormick flatlined multiple times while being airlifted to the hospital and on the operating table. In a twist of fate, he got a second chance at life — the rising star made huge strides on his road to recovery. After spending 79 days in the hospital, receiving multiple surgeries, which included open heart surgery, he found his voice again.</p><p>Fans who tuned in to catch the latest episode of Idol got to hear McCormick’s voice as he delivered a top-notch rendition of <a href=#>Rascal Flatts</a>’ “Bless the Broken Road.”&nbsp;His cover, which included numerous vocal runs and natural vibrato, had Richie uncontrollably weeping.</p><p>“Got me, boy,” Richie said, through tears, as Perry tried to console him.</p><p>Afterward, all three judges got up to give McCormick hugs before delivering their comments on his performance.</p><p>“I just got to say it. I mean. The last person I saw approach singing like you was <a href=#>Willie Spence</a>,” Bryan said, while Richie agreed. “It’s the same approach.”</p><p>“I mean, you hit one of those notes, and I thought of Willie, and from then on, I couldn’t recover,” Richie shared of the former Idol contestant, who <a href=#>died in a car accident in 2022</a>. “I was trying to look very dignified, and then you just beat me up some more. But let me tell you this. God brought you back nine times for you to do something amazing. I’m so glad you’re here with us. That was just one of those moments in my life that I’ll never forget.”</p><p>“Elijah. Do you understand that this is the beginning of your story?” Perry added before McCormick revealed that his mother signed him up for Idol before his accident.</p><p>“Wait. What? So you’re just here fulfilling your destiny,” Perry confirmed before all three judges invited McCormick’s mother into the audition room to include her in the news that her son would be competing in Hollywood Week.</p><p>“I was not supposed to be here. I have to fulfill my purpose,” McCormick, who earned his golden ticket, shared.</p><p>American Idol airs Sundays at 8PM ET on ABC.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>14 'American Idol' Singers Who Secretly Hooked Up — Or Did They?</h2>At least two couples who met through <a href=#>American Idol</a> got married, while one more could be headed in that direction. Not all American Idol hookups have a happy ending, however. Here are seven of the most talked about meet-ups, plus the real scoop on how serious things got.<h2 class=photogallery-title>PICTURES: See Inside Carrie Underwood's Beautiful Post-'American Idol' Home</h2><p>Carrie Underwood invested her money wisely after winning American Idol in 2005. One of her first big purchases was a 3,099-square-foot home in the well-to-do Nashville suburb of Franklin, Tenn. Underwood paid $384,000 for a luxurious 3-bedroom, 3.5-bathroom stone and stucco home in a private gated community.</p><p>The house features a library, a vaulted ceiling and lovely amenities throughout, but while it's very nice, it's certainly not the kind of home you'd picture for a budding country superstar. Underwood wound up being a huge success right out of the gate with her debut album, Some Hearts, and she sold the home in Franklin for $372,500 in 2007, when she purchased the Brentwood mansion that she would later share with her husband, Mike Fisher.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmmqWVp7akrc1moJ2nnGKyrbXJmp9mpZOYvLO5yJyiZqqRqLCiuIyfo5qspKh6o7jErKpmrJiaeqO%2BzqScp2WipK6lew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./entertainment.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'MacGyver' Cast: Catch Up With the Original Crew</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sean-hannity-florida-house-townhome-pictures.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sean Hannity Moves to Florida See Inside His Stunning Home!</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amal-clooney-mob-wife-trend-cream-fur-coat.html>Amal Clooney Elevates the Mob Wife Trend in a Cream Fur Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./demolition-underway-at-washington-elementary-davenport.html>Demolition underway at Washington Elementary, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iowa-man-killed-in-head-on-crash.html>Iowa man killed in head-on crash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./style-edit-richard-milles-technically-ambitious-new-rm-30-01-automatic-luxury-watch-was-inspired.html>Style Edit: Richard Milles technically ambitious new RM 30-01 Automatic luxury watch was inspired</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./463481-what-happened-frankie-lons-life-story-death.html>What happened to Frankie Lons?
