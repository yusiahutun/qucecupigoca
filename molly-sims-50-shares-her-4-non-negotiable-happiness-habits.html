Yet, for model and TV presenter <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">Molly Sims</a>, 50,&nbsp; happiness isn't just a fleeting emotion—it's a way of life cultivated through deliberate self-care habits and practices.&nbsp;</p><p id=eLGhDfv9ZBs data-wc=61>As a model who has graced the covers of the world’s most famous fashion magazines including Vogue, Marie Claire, Elle, Glamour and Allure, Molly understands the pressures of perfection. However, rather than succumb to these ideals, especially now as a 50-year-old working mom of 3, Molly has made it a priority to prioritize her mental and emotional well-being above all else.&nbsp;</p><p id=eNEZSN17uSB data-wc=12>HELLO! caught up with Molly to find out how she does it…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6a36b0e44b2c-molly-sims-2.jpg><h2 dir=ltr>Don’t fight anxiety, manifest it away</h2><p id=e18UChben_J data-wc=59>One of the cornerstone habits in Molly’s life is practicing positive self-talk and remembering to always appreciate the blessings in her life, big and small, especially when she’s anxious. “I am learning a lot from <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Gabby Bernstein</a>,” Molly explains to HELLO! “I downloaded her <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>app</a> and I listen to her guided manifestation for three minutes when I'm feeling anxious.”&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="I silenced my inner critic and become more confident than ever" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/63dfb6ce76be-image001-1.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="I silenced my inner critic and become more confident than ever" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>I silenced my inner critic and become more confident than ever</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><h2 dir=ltr>Embrace imperfections &nbsp;</h2><p id=eLrXKqnA10E data-wc=43>Molly told HELLO! that she had suffered from cystic acne and pigmentation for many years, but instead of letting this get her down, she found that developing a positive attitude and the right self-care has helped her love the skin she is in. &nbsp;</p><p id=eIU8qonMU0 data-wc=77>One of Molly’s favorite daily self-care habits to help treat her skin and her mood is red light therapy. “I like the <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Dr Dennis Gross</a> masks,” she explains. “I have had cystic acne for years, and red light therapy really does work. It’s great for inflammation and great at killing bacteria.” Molly also developed her own simple skincare system - which she now sells and is called <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">Yse</a> - &nbsp;that is super gentle yet gives amazing results.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/96f403ef73cb-gettyimages-2074989527.jpg><h2 dir=ltr>Focus on the positives, especially for your health&nbsp;</h2><p id=exVyp9bhfEgF data-wc=66>Molly believes in the power of positive thinking, especially when it comes to her health. “I don’t read about the side effects of things because then I’ll just get them in my head. And if I believe something helps me, then I mentally feel good which helps me physically too. I know it sounds crazy, but really believing in something that you're doing makes a difference.”&nbsp;</p><p id=e8zDw4spOM data-wc=14><strong>INSPIRATION:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>I took a 'grey gap year' at 51 – here's what I learned</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eS2igoYk7wN data-wc=86>One of Molly’s favorite health hacks is taking collagen every day, and the easiest way is by mixing collagen powder into her favorite drinks. “I’ve got into the habit of mixing <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Isopure Collagen Peptides</a> into my tea and coffee every day. I’ve found that whatever way you can get collagen into your system is really important, especially as I’m getting older. My hair has been really difficult since I had children, but this has been great for my hair, my skin, my nails…and my joints too.”&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>If things don’t turn out as planned, learn to pivot</h2><p id=eSDFQEjNFb48 data-wc=64>Knowing and accepting that life can often throw you some curveballs helps Molly navigate her daily life with less anxiety and stress. “The one thing I’ve learnt as I’ve got older is that I can pivot,” Molly explains. “I had a hard couple of years, and I’ve accepted that not everything's going to work out, and that you’ve got to go with the flow.”</p><h3 class="factBoxTitleClass_f1xis0ve hm-heading">Introducing HELLO!'s Second Act</h3><p id=eiD7O9qMgeX></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a9e539ce4e72-happy-women.jpg><p id=ek0cRP1Gab>HELLO! wanted to create a space dedicated to sharing incredible stories from midlife; somewhere you can find inspiring stories of like-minded women, living their best life beyond 45.</p><p id=eIVzsetUJy>Enter, Second Act...</p><p id=ee8vP2pa6o>For too long, we were expected to fade into the background when we hit 45, but we're here to reframe your Second Act as a celebratory, exciting new chapter with endless possibilities ahead.</p><p id=ejWkVSwbj3>From women who embarked on new careers in their fifties, to those who travelled the world alone after their children left home, to women who finally felt confident when they reached their forties, Second Act is devoted to celebrating the incredible stories of midlife, and we'd love to have you along for the journey - because being part of a community makes everything more enjoyable.</p><p id=ew6nPeFBc9><a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>Visit HELLO!'s Second Act hub&nbsp;</a></p><p id=ews-Q5_QbT5></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfncKjv46snJynnpl6oq%2FTaGxqbmZsgHC5zqWjsmWjnrq0eZRpZKygkaeytHnHnqlmbF2jvK95zZ6eqKyZlq%2BtsYyhmKmomaOytL%2BMoZiboaSofA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mom-trial-murder-laughed-told-cops-didnt-think-dead-babies-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mom on trial for murder LAUGHED as she told cops she 'didn't even think' of her dead babies</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mr-t-wife-children-net-worth-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Get to Know Mr. T's Wife, Children &amp;amp; Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amal-clooney-mob-wife-trend-cream-fur-coat.html>Amal Clooney Elevates the Mob Wife Trend in a Cream Fur Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./demolition-underway-at-washington-elementary-davenport.html>Demolition underway at Washington Elementary, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iowa-man-killed-in-head-on-crash.html>Iowa man killed in head-on crash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./style-edit-richard-milles-technically-ambitious-new-rm-30-01-automatic-luxury-watch-was-inspired.html>Style Edit: Richard Milles technically ambitious new RM 30-01 Automatic luxury watch was inspired</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./463481-what-happened-frankie-lons-life-story-death.html>What happened to Frankie Lons?
