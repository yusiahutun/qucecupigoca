However, that doesn’t stop me—and I bet you, too—from wondering what celebrities such as Bey and Kim are really like in real life, which is why I tracked down expert&nbsp;graphologist (she has more three decades of experience!)&nbsp;<strong>Sheila Kurtz</strong> from <a href=# rel=nofollow>Scan My Handwriting</a>, a New York–based company&nbsp;that specializes in breaking down handwriting for&nbsp;anyone looking for a little more introspection, or businesses looking for insight into a potential job candidate.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/killers-of-the-flower-moon-fi.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-1257369662.jpg><p>Here’s what Kurtz had to say about the handwriting of four big celebrities.</p><p><a href=# rel="attachment wp-att-533196"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rihanna1.png alt="RIHANNA celebrity handwriting" width=710 height=780 sizes="(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p class=p1>See how <a href=# id=auto-tag_rihanna data-tag=rihanna>Rihanna</a>‘s script flows elegantly and without any interruption?

Graphologists measure intuition in the number of breaks between letters in words, and Watson’s style shows that she tends to cover up her tendency to act on gut feelings. She also tends to go back and connect letters that might otherwise go naturally unconnected.
