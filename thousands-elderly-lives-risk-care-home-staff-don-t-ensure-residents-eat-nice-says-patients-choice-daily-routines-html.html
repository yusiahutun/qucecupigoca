available, reflects a growing concern that many care homes are run for the convenience of staff rather than residents.</span></p>The person’s needs should come before what is most convenient for the

needed help with meals were ignored.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Concerns have also been raised about the failure of care homes to give residents enough to drink – often because staff do not want to be bothered with helping residents to use the toilet in the middle of the night.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Both failures can lead rapidly to hospital admission and a high likelihood of death for the patient.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>The NICE warnings came on the day the Daily Mail reported that two workers had been arrested on suspicion of

patients.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Professor Leng said: ‘Our recommendations advise that people living in care homes should be helped to retain their independence and identity, for example through supporting them to take part in activities they enjoy, and allowing them to go at their own pace.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘It is also important to respect a person’s right to make their own decisions if they still have the capacity to do so.
