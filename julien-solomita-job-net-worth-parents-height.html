Julien announced their nuptial in an IG post by sharing a number of photographs from their big day with a caption, “<span class="_aacl _aaco _aacu _aacx _aad7 _aade">married otters &lt;3.” The couple celebrated their wedding day with Jenna’s dogs at her side,</span></p><p>The 36-year-old, whose actual name is Jenna Mourey, was seen brushing her teeth, getting a kiss on the forehead from Julien, 30, and crying at the altar. The beauty was depicted in a black-and-white photograph donning a princess-styled gown, with long sleeves and a deep V-neck on the lace upper half of the dress. The bottom was made of a stunning tulle skirt that fell down behind her into a train. She had a bright smile on her face and added some fun to the photo by donning a pair of white-rimmed sunglasses. Jenna’s blonde hair was parted to the side and accessorized with a long, sheer veil and a rhinestone headband.</p><p>Julien also looked the part with a tailored suit and coordinating waistcoat. He wore a bolo tie and loafers to add some style to the look. In the first picture, he was also sporting a pair of sunglasses.</p><p>Per PageSix, they started dating in 2013 and revealed that they were engaged in April 2021. Julien revealed that he had asked Jenna to marry him, explaining during a Twitch video that, ‘A little while ago, this is so weird, I asked Jenna to marry me and she said yes. So, we are engaged,’ reported&nbsp;E! News.</p><p>The proposal took place, Julien clarified, “maybe longer ago than you think,” adding that despite Marbles giving him a temporary ring of his own, he removed it during Twitch streams.</p><p>“I’m very excited, and it feels good to get the words out because I wanted to tell you for a while and I didn’t because it was giving me anxiety so I just kind of held onto it,” the groom shared at the time. “I think today I realized it was kind of flipped, and it was giving me more anxiety to kind of hold on to it, so there’s the news.”</p><p>Jenna has been virtually inactive since 2020 and stopped creating content after she received hate for earlier videos that were labeled as racist content. Since then, Julien has been solely responsible for giving updates on their relationship.</p><h3><strong>Julien Solomita Job</strong></h3><p>Julien Solomita is a Twitch streamer and YouTuber.
