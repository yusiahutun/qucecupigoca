Consider this a humble attempt to keep his memory alive just a little while longer, to remind everyone that such a consequential voice of conscience is no longer with us.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I never got to meet the man in person, but I was fortunate enough to keep in touch with Pilger long distance over the last couple of years, and had the privilege of recording a long conversation with him on camera via video link in July 2022. An encouragingly large number of people watched and appreciated the interview shared on the South China Morning Post’s YouTube channel, and he in turn was appreciative when I told him how well his words of wisdom on world affairs resonated among our audience.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2022/07/07/TalkingPost_Thumbnail_JohnPilger_Plain.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">20:37</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">‘This is a war of propaganda’: John Pilger on Ukraine and Assange | Talking Post with Yonden Lhatoo</p><p>‘This is a war of propaganda’: John Pilger on Ukraine and Assange | Talking Post with Yonden Lhatoo</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When I contacted Pilger again late last year for a follow-up interview, he told me he had been unwell and was not long out of hospital but would perhaps be able to do it later. I did not realise how serious it was at the time, but had planned to check in on him again with a New Year’s greeting, only to learn the news of his death.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The loss of a journalist of Pilger’s calibre and stature seems all the more immense in these times, when public trust in the media is so low, sadly not without justification, and when so many tend to consume the news not to stay informed but rather to look for validation of their personal biases and identity politics. Never has the need for voices of reason like his been so acute, nor the replenishing pool so dry.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As a reporter, author and filmmaker, Pilger was a giant of journalism, an indefatigable seeker of truth and uncompromising chronicler of inconvenient facts that you would otherwise be hard-pressed to glean from the dominant narrative of the legacy Anglo-Saxon media and its conqueror’s perspective of history.</p>His reporting on Asia, in particular, was eye-opening journalism, and his experience as a war correspondent covering major conflicts from <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Vietnam</span></a> and <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Cambodia</span></a> through to <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Iraq</span></a> and across the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Middle East</span></a> shaped him into a tireless campaigner for the casualties of Western imperialism and interference. He was a staunch defender of the downtrodden, just as much as he was a fearless critic of the powerful, especially in the geopolitical context.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2022/07/07/TalkingPost_Thumbnail_JohnPilger_Plain.jpg>Pilger was deeply concerned about the possibility of the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">United States</span></a> and its allies provoking a catastrophic war with <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">China</span></a>, and constantly called them out for it.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">His 2016 documentary, The Coming War on China, should be mandatory viewing for anyone seeking to understand who exactly poses the greatest danger to world peace, and why it has everything to do with the mightiest superpower on the planet attempting to contain the rise of a rival by any means deemed necessary. What sounded so prescient in that exemplary piece of journalism seven years ago now seems alarmingly imminent.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He updated those sentiments in an opinion piece that the Post published in May 2023:</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I write this on the anniversary of the last day of the longest war of the 20th century, in Vietnam, which I reported and left me with vivid lessons.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“All through that war, the propaganda said a victorious Vietnam would allow the Great Yellow Peril to its north to sweep down. Countries would fall like ‘dominoes’. Ho Chi Minh’s Vietnam was victorious, and none of the above happened. Instead, Vietnamese civilisation blossomed, remarkably, in spite of the price they paid: 3 million dead by one count.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“If the current propagandists – call them provocateurs – get their war with China, this figure will be a fraction of what is sure to come.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/01/24/d4c87f18-2e2b-4741-85b3-87b269c05382_3e4cbe15.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">You can imagine why this kind of heretical voice would not be allowed to interrupt the chanting of the “China-threat” mantra by the legacy Western media parroting the propaganda of their governments and politicians. Just as he was labelled a “pinko commie” for daring to say anything positive about China, Pilger was similarly derided for the slightest defence of Russia, and branded an “anti-Semite” for having the temerity to speak up for the Palestinians.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When I asked him what kept him going against such odds, he replied: “Sometimes I feel like giving up, but I have such a passion for journalism. It’s addictive, and it’s been addictive all my life, and I believe it is so important. And when you’re faced with the day-after-day examples of the worst kind of journalism that isn’t journalism at all, then I think that’s only further encouragement to keep going.”</p>Pilger was an inspiration to me when I started out as a rookie reporter, so I was unashamedly flattered when he expressed his own appreciation for my work, specifically my ranting about the hypocrisy of Western governments and their media acolytes preaching press freedom while one of their own, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Julian Assange</span></a>, rots in jail as a tragic victim of their vindictive double standards. Pilger fought for his release until the end.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“People like you make the world a better place,” I told him on camera. Allow me to update that sentiment by declaring that the world is worse off without him, and my profession all the poorer for it.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Goodbye, John.
