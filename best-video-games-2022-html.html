Overall sales have swooned since 2021, which analysts have chalked up to both regression from the COVID boom and the lack of a central, needle-moving blockbuster on the release schedule. It’s hard to squabble with that point as you take stock of the cycle; 2022 did not contain a marquee installment to a galactic franchise — Starfield, Final Fantasy XVI, and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom are each earmarked for 2023. Instead, we received a constant trickle of eccentric, offbeat projects that seemed destined to appeal, unapologetically, to a very specific type of video-game fetishist. Our top-ten list for 2022 contains ’90s-worshipping arcade throwbacks, wooly economic simulators, eldritch dungeon crawls, and ultra-high-concept RPGs. There was always something fascinating on the horizon this year, and while gamers weren’t swallowed up by a white-hot Zeitgeist, the hobby never ceases to blow our minds.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy hanging-item" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clb6omeqb009j3b6vgqqlltf6@published><span class=ordered-list-item><p class=list-item-text>10.</p></span>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge (Nintendo Switch, PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clb6ol9ty00653b6vcxg0qog1@published data-word-count=150>If you are a child of the ’90s, you likely once fantasized about a world with unlimited quarters. The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle arcade games that paneled barbershops and bowling alleys were notoriously difficult, designed specifically to separate you from your allowance by the time you hit the second level. But in 2022, millennials finally had the chance to enact their revenge. Shredder’s Revenge is a full-throated tribute to the twilight of the arcade era, when beat-’em-ups reigned supreme. You and a gaggle of friends churn through a legion of identical, purple-clad ninjas, without ever fearing a trip to the change machine again. The campaign is swollen with all sorts of vintage TMNT throwbacks, which will cement you back at your happy place: standing in the corner of a Chuck E. Cheese, a slice of pizza propped against the joystick, with one of those infinite weekend afternoons ahead of you.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=xAeqlz data-merchant-id=202087 data-track-name="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge" data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Limited Run Games" data-track-price=35 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$35</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$35</span> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=xAeqlz data-merchant-id=202087 data-track-name="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=35 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true>Buy at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class="product-buy-link narrativ-link" data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - narrativ button" data-track-id=xAeqlz data-merchant-id=202087 data-track-name="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=35 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$35</span> at Amazon Buy</a><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy hanging-item" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clb6pekss004y3b6wybhvv657@published><span class=ordered-list-item><p class=list-item-text>9.</p></span>Disney Dreamlight Valley (Mac, Nintendo Switch, PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clb6ol9tz00673b6vnliy6of8@published data-word-count=141>It is a little strange that more developers haven’t aped the tried-and-true Animal Crossing formula. Gameloft, the venerable mobile-oriented studio, finally took the bait in the best way possible. Disney Dreamlight Valley, as the name implies, sends you to an overgrown hamlet that was — at least once upon a time — home to a variety of Disney characters. As you clear out the bramble and break away the stone, slowly but surely, those former residents make their return, eager to present players with a bucolic, homesteading fantasy. At last, a chance to furnish a home with Remy the rat, or tend the garden with Mickey Mouse, or enjoy the sunset with Kristoff. Dreamlight Valley is textbook emotional manipulation, but it effortlessly captures the core fantasy of the average Disney Adult. Life would be so much simpler with friends like these.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=aUuBIX data-merchant-id=195520 data-track-name="Disney Dreamlight Valley" data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Steam data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=29.99 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>Disney Dreamlight Valley</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$30</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$30</span> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=aUuBIX data-merchant-id=195520 data-track-name="Disney Dreamlight Valley" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Steam data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=29.99 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true>Buy at Steam Buy</a><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy hanging-item" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clb6pmynl009b3b6wyaogamfp@published><span class=ordered-list-item><p class=list-item-text>8.</p></span>Victoria 3 (Mac, PC)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clb6ol9u000693b6vs1mijwzy@published data-word-count=130>The grand strategy titans of Paradox Interactive tend to stick with antiquity in their games. Crusader Kings and Europa Universalis are both set in the High Middle Ages — an age of kings and regents — where swaths of territory can change hands with a severed bloodline. But Victoria 3 shifts the parameters to the 19th century, where the stakes are a tad more relatable. You are given the controls of the commodity market at the dawn of globalization: managing an economy, organizing trade routes, and charting the political future of your people. Will you plunge the United States into socialist revolution? Grind the East India Trading Company to a halt? Reverse the forces of colonization in the heart of Africa? Victoria 3 gives us the world.

Is it the low-key cyberpunk aesthetic? The tastefully implemented puzzles? The plights of the sad-sack robots inhabiting this fallen world? No, not at all. Stray succeeds because it is a full-throated love letter to cat people. Your orange tabby can scratch up carpets, ruin couches, haphazardly knock over household items, and make those uniquely feline leaps into tight spaces. Never has so much effort been made to re-create, in exacting detail, the proclivities and mercurialness of the average house cat. No wonder BlueTwelve had us eating out of its hands.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=21mbKf data-merchant-id=190903 data-track-name=Stray﻿ data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Steam data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=29.99 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>Stray</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$30</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$30</span> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=21mbKf data-merchant-id=190903 data-track-name=Stray﻿ data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Steam data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=29.99 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true>Buy at Steam Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - custom second buy button" data-track-id=21mbKf data-merchant-id=190904 data-track-name=Stray﻿ data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=PlayStation data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=29.99 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign><span class=product-buy-price>$30</span> at PlayStation Buy</a><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy hanging-item" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clb6pviox00nd3b6w5rrkxzmj@published><span class=ordered-list-item><p class=list-item-text>6.</p></span>Nobody Saves the World (PC, Xbox One)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clb6ol9u8006d3b6vh3cq04al@published data-word-count=194>That title is more literal than you might think. In Nobody Saves the World, you take control of a little white blob named, you guessed it, Nobody. He’s slow, feeble, and weak-minded, but he can transform into a whole slew of RPG archetypes to conquer the dungeons splayed across this saturated, Saturday-morning cartoon landscape. Yes, Nobody can become a wizard or a warrior, who are both outfitted with tons of D&D tropes — but he can also swap into a turtle equipped with a ricocheting Koopa Troopa attack, or a slug who can ink the combat arenas with speed-dampening slime. That is when Nobody Saves the World sings; ping-ponging between a litany of forms and finding the peculiar synergies within. As it turns out, a rat and a dragon make for a devastating one-two punch. Oftentimes I finish an RPG with a lingering regret that I rolled the wrong character and that I would’ve had more fun with, say, a greater emphasis on an ignored school of magic. Nobody Saves the World renders that problem totally irrelevant. By the time the credits roll, you’ll have seen everything that little white blob is capable of.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=b1zQMy data-merchant-id=180822 data-track-name="Nobody Saves the World" data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Steam data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=24.99 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>Nobody Saves the World</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$25</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$25</span> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=b1zQMy data-merchant-id=180822 data-track-name="Nobody Saves the World" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Steam data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=24.99 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true>Buy at Steam Buy</a><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy hanging-item" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clb6pynyn00tq3b6wnifilylm@published><span class=ordered-list-item><p class=list-item-text>5.</p></span>Splatoon 3 (Nintendo Switch)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clb6ol9u8006f3b6v5kis0u3u@published data-word-count=201>There is an argument to be made that Splatoon has been on cruise control since the first game in the series emerged as a surprise hit for Nintendo during its dark, financially precarious Wii U era. Yes, it is true that Splatoon 3 very much resembles Splatoon 2, which itself was a modest — but insubstantial — refining of the ideas in the original. You are still going to be battling other punky squidling teenagers for superiority, coating the map in your national colors with a variety of esoteric water guns that dispense massive, oily payloads of ink in a variety of different shapes. (Ink shotguns, pistols, sniper rifles, and so on.) The innovations in the combat will only be noticed by the most ardent Splatoon addicts; the ability to boost out of wall-runs is surely transformative for the Über-competitive scene, but will mostly be unnoticed by laymen. And yet, Splatoon 3 is the best the series has ever been, and it’s rarely left my Switch for long. There may come a time when Nintendo needs to drastically reengineer the blueprint, but for now, I’m more than happy with a few new wrinkles, and lively multiplayer servers, every couple of years.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=RPKzhX data-merchant-id=193673 data-track-name="Splatoon 3" data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Nintendo of America" data-track-price=55 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>Splatoon 3</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$55</span> $60<span> now 8% off</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$55</span> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=RPKzhX data-merchant-id=193673 data-track-name="Splatoon 3" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=55 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true>Buy at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - custom second buy button" data-track-id=RPKzhX data-merchant-id=195280 data-track-name="Splatoon 3" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Target data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=60 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$60</span> at Target Buy</a><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy hanging-item" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clb6q2cob01073b6w1jta5tyx@published><span class=ordered-list-item><p class=list-item-text>4.</p></span>Marvel Snap (Android, iOS, PC)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clb6ol9ub006h3b6vy1paaz8p@published data-word-count=161>You can complete a game of Marvel Snap in three minutes. This is a Magic-style collectible card game shrunk down to its base atomic particles. You’ll have a deck containing only 12 cards, and over the course of six turns you’ll battle for supremacy at three different locations; win two of them, and you’ll claim victory. The design team is made up of Hearthstone veterans, who they bring that game’s silly, flavor-rich splendor to the Marvel universe. (For instance: Mr. Fantastic, with his long limbs, can boost your power at two adjacent locations at once.) But by far, the team’s best innovation is its titular gambit; if you think you’re ahead — even on turn one — tap the Snap button at the top of your screen. You’ll double your rewards if you claim victory, and risk brutal punishment if your hubris fails. Marvel Snap is built for bathroom breaks and subway-station transfers, and it passes that test with flying colors.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=EfCPr7 data-merchant-id=202094 data-track-name="Marvel Snap" data-track-option=name data-track-merchant="Apple App Store" data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=0 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>Marvel Snap</span></a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=EfCPr7 data-merchant-id=202094 data-track-name="Marvel Snap" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant="Apple App Store" data-track-manufacturer data-track-price data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true>Free at Apple App Store Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - custom second buy button" data-track-id=EfCPr7 data-merchant-id=202093 data-track-name="Marvel Snap" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant="Google Play" data-track-manufacturer data-track-price data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true>Free at Google Play Buy</a><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy hanging-item" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clb6q8534016s3b6w2mq0vpfs@published><span class=ordered-list-item><p class=list-item-text>3.</p></span>Tunic (Mac, PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series S/X)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clb6ol9ub006j3b6vpx6but1s@published data-word-count=158>Tunic is a Legend of Zelda game with a deviant streak. You are exploring a diorama realm filled with monsters that are no match for your sword and shield, but you’ll quickly discover that everything in this game — the dialogue, the signs, even the pieces of the in-universe manual you find scattered around the atlas — is written in a coded language. It is up to you to parse the runes, and the only tools in your inventory are cunning and guile. Those moments where you discover a whole new dimension hiding in plain sight are Tunic’s lifeblood. It lends to a genuine sense of metaphysical puzzle-solving.

You are a celestial sinner — on the bubble of purgatory — who needs to prove his mettle before gaining access to heaven. The evil-eyed demons in your path can’t muster much more offense than an evil glare; most of them will be easily dispatched with one pull from your divine arsenal of firearms. No, the true villain in Neon White is the timer, which can mercilessly separate you from a gold or a bronze medal in a matter of seconds. The levels in Neon White can usually be completed in a minute or less, and they each require a tight network of air-dashes, double-jumps, and Super Mario–style ground pounds — like a parkour sizzle reel in zero gravity. When it all comes together, Neon White is a master class of momentum and control, even as you’re struggling to shave that last millisecond off the registrar to guarantee your immortality.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=AvDAh1 data-merchant-id=189593 data-track-name="Neon White" data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Steam data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=24.99 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>Neon White</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$25</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$25</span> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=AvDAh1 data-merchant-id=189593 data-track-name="Neon White" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Steam data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=24.99 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true>Buy at Steam Buy</a><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy hanging-item" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clb6qeqt301ka3b6wu2jdbxwt@published><span class=ordered-list-item><p class=list-item-text>1.</p></span>Elden Ring (PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S/X)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clb6ol9uc006n3b6vlcfjmaaw@published data-word-count=207>If you recall the decaying gothic ramparts in Dark Souls, or the condemned Victorian hell of Bloodborne, then you already know that when FromSoftware is at its best, the studio creates some of the most iconic settings you’ll ever find in a video game. <a href=#>Elden Ring</a> expanded on From’s tried-and-true formula — a dense, clockwork universe packed with furtive secrets and ecclesiastic lore — into, perhaps, the largest world ever rendered on a console. The Lands Between, where Elden Ring takes place, encompasses about 30 square miles of digital real estate. It takes a player three and a half hours to walk across its diameter, and they’ll find 157 unique boss fights across innumerable dungeons, alcoves, and temples along the way. FromSoftware took no shortcuts; every inch of this forsaken realm is authored and intentional, operating with a euphoric indifference toward the player. Will you find all of its secrets? Elden Ring could care less. You can play for hours before discovering a nondescript marble elevator that sinks down to a verdant underground river coursing, eternally, below our feet. The world map pleats open, revealing even more for us to chew on. Elden Ring’s scale is a singular achievement. I still can’t believe they pulled it off.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=LTEYhM data-merchant-id=225649 data-track-name="Elden Ring" data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Target data-track-manufacturer="Bandai Namco" data-track-price=50 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>Elden Ring</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$50</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$50</span> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=LTEYhM data-merchant-id=225649 data-track-name="Elden Ring" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Target data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=50 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true>Buy at Target Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - custom second buy button" data-track-id=LTEYhM data-merchant-id=225650 data-track-name="Elden Ring" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant="Best Buy" data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=50 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$50</span> at Best Buy Buy</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clb6qhxsz01r63b6wwlsv35p2@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Honorable Mentions</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clb6qij9k01sw3b6wirwtpw63@published data-word-count=39>Throughout 2022, Luke Winkie maintained a “Best Video Games of the Year (So Far)” list.

This year’s foremost Steam breakout hit is a satisfying meld of all sorts of other fantasy homesteading simulators (think Minecraft, Valheim, and Terraria) except, this time, your sprightly survivalist is lost in an expansive, procedurally generated network of caverns. Core Keeper strikes a sublime balance between precarious dungeoneering and the cozy chores back home.

Over the past three years, we received new editions in the primary series with Sword and Shield as well as remasters of two DS classics in Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl. Those games all sold extraordinarily well, proving the <a href=#>Pokémon formula remains lucrative</a> 30 years after Red and Blue. But Pokémon Legends: Arceus provides an alternative timeline in which Nintendo abandoned the Über-simplistic RPG trappings for something <a href=#>a little more substantial</a>. Here you are: a Pokémon trainer alone in the wilds enjoying a crisper, spookier vision of what life among the untamed Pikachus would actually be like. Sneak up on Pokémon and blindside them with a Poké Ball, battle down your prey without being locked into a turn-based slog, and run for your life after angering a giant Electrode.

But if you missed Uncharted 4 or The Lost Legacy when they first arrived in 2016 and 2017, The Legacy of Thieves is absolutely worth a look on the spiffy PlayStation 5. The Uncharted series typically presents Nathan Drake as an unruly man-child who grows weirdly petulant whenever he doesn’t get his way, but the fourth and final game in the narrative was the first to actually scrutinize his selfishness. (It’s one of the best action games of the past ten years.) And The Lost Legacy, the mini-chapter that focuses on two of the franchise’s most beloved characters, found Naughty Dog experimenting with an open-world gestalt that still has me excited for whatever the company is cooking up next. It will likely be a long time before we get another Uncharted game, and that’s probably for the best.

You’re asked to pore over an encyclopedia of phytologic caveats with just a few clues, slowly narrowing down the exceptions and edge cases until you are sure, without a doubt, that the man in your shop needs the plant with blue flowers and triangle-shaped leaves.

The game includes the same arsenal and characters as Ubisoft’s venerated first-person shooter Rainbow 6 Siege, but it trades the squad-based multiplayer for a horror-flick romp through an obscene, viscerally unsettling alien apocalypse. The antiseptic halls and corporate antechambers crucial to the franchise’s muted aesthetic have been overrun by oozing pustules, curdled zombies, and infectious muck — think John Carpenter’s The Thing with SWAT teams — as you and two friends attempt to complete a trio of challenges before succumbing to the horde. I went into Extraction with exceedingly low expectations, and I found a game that evoked the morbid, white-knuckle thrills of the best high-stakes XCOM missions. Did you leave behind one of your friends in the churn? Next mission you gear up to free them from the clutches of the parasite, or else they’ll suffer a punitive progression tax.

Oh, and you explore underground ruins that appear to be the abandoned laboratories of a much more modern human race. The original game, which arrived in 2017, did a fantastic job of spindling together all of these wild plot threads, and that diligence continues in Forbidden West. Gameplay-wise, this is still a competent open-world adventure that’s at its best when you’re facing off against one of those aluminum-plated T.

We wreaked havoc from Napoleon’s front lines to the Oda clan of feudal Japan, forever bound by the limits of planet Earth. But developer Creative Assembly pivoted to orcs, elves, and demons with 2016’s Total War: Warhammer, and six years later, we have received the conclusion of the trilogy. Like the previous games, Warhammer puts you at the helm of a marauding army eager to meet its rival force on the open field of battle. There is plenty of positional strategy to calculate, yet Total War is more about sitting back and enjoying the grand viscera when your cavalry executes a perfectly timed flank. Warhammer differs from its forebears with its emphasis on narrative. Creative Assembly is free of the analects here and has carte blanche to dream up gristly scenarios involving the many putrid creatures that populate the Warhammer canon. If you’ve always been curious about this grimdark universe but never felt the urge to paint those expensive pewter statues, Total War is a fantastic jumping-off point.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=z3tiT2 data-merchant-id=180825 data-track-name="Total War: Warhammer III" data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Steam data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=59.99 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>Total War: Warhammer III</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$60</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$60</span> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=z3tiT2 data-merchant-id=180825 data-track-name="Total War: Warhammer III" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Steam data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=59.99 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true>Buy at Steam Buy</a><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl08gun7y00153f6rhufs6cft@published>Sifu (PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/2c7/c4c/088ec9e3f118d802c51a41206a06483626-norco.rhorizontal.w700.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl08gv8d6001p3f6rez371cj8@published data-word-count=151>The beat-’em-up is dead.

Sifu has no plot other than a <a href=#>warmed-over collection of kung fu tropes</a>, and its gameplay never deviates across a seven-hour running time. (Angry men want you dead. Show them no mercy with your fists.) But that doesn’t matter because meshing together a package of punches and kicks on some nameless heavy leaning on a pool table feels as good as it did in 1993. For those of us who love getting lost in an intuitive combat system, Sifu is close to heaven on earth.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl5jyfdhp00113b7js6fufqj7@published data-word-count=6>Read Lewis Gordon’s <a href=#>review of Sifu</a>.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=FKCbap data-merchant-id=180814 data-track-name=Sifu data-track-option=name data-track-merchant="Epic Games" data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=39.99 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>Sifu</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$40</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$40</span> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=FKCbap data-merchant-id=180814 data-track-name=Sifu data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant="Epic Games" data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=39.99 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true>Buy at Epic Games Buy</a><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl08h4ckb00193f6ttqb3imwr@published>OlliOlli World (Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series S/X)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/153/2e4/959d729e03fb860102618a0fb88b12a703-ghostwire.rhorizontal.w700.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl08h6vg100143f6t7rv33hea@published data-word-count=125>We’re in the midst of a minor skateboarding-game renaissance, which is unsurprisingly peaking right alongside a wave of early-aughts Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater nostalgia. OlliOlli World doesn’t take much inspiration from those classics. Instead, it brings skateboarding to a two-dimensional plane where forward momentum is king. Each level puts you into a hellacious obstacle course bracketed by ramps, rails, and half-pipes; your core goal is to make it through the checkpoints in one piece. In practice, that means you’ll be blending wall rides and 5-0 grinds like clockwork, creating a rhythmic, almost parkourlike cadence with your repertoire of tricks. But what makes OlliOlli World uniquely memorable is its slacker-utopia aesthetic. Who wouldn’t want to live on a planet that can be navigated only by kickflips?</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=4s2gp0 data-merchant-id=180817 data-track-name="OlliOlli World" data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Nintendo data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=29.99 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>OlliOlli World</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$30</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$30</span> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=4s2gp0 data-merchant-id=180817 data-track-name="OlliOlli World" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Nintendo data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=29.99 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true>Buy at Nintendo Buy</a><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl438hx5k00323f78kvz8hd5e@published>Norco (MacOS, Windows PC)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/049/650/5babfcc9b791fe1f7ef06921d02d9dc558-weird-west.rhorizontal.w700.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl438kb5t00443f783hpp57bz@published data-word-count=108>Norco is a real place.

It has left American suburbia behind in favor of an eldritch, rain-slicked Tokyo, haunted by every vengeful spirit in the Japanese legendarium. Ghostwire can be dragged down by its grind at times, but I’ve remained captivated by its silky first-person animation and vivid enemy design as well as the resonant hometown pride Tango takes in its capital city. This is a game in which you will banish demons before stopping into an ersatz 7-Eleven for some health-restoring mochi.

It has made landfall in Harry Potter, Marvel, DC, and the Tolkien legendarium, but Star Wars was always its first — and best — home. The Skywalker Saga is the studio’s chance to be truly definitive in its relentless documentation of pop media, and quite frankly, no other game bearing the Rebel crest has ever crammed this much Star Wars into its source code. There are six different playable versions of Lando Calrissian. You can take control of Malakili, the guy who owns the Rancor monster in Jabba’s palace. On Tatooine, there is a reference to a “ghost droid” that exclusively appeared in a popular piece of non-canon fanfiction. Traveller’s Tales left no stone unturned, and the result is a living encyclopedia of both the glorious heights and abyssal lows of Star Wars.

We are suddenly inundated by Dune movies, Dune board games, Dune comic books — and someone at Warner Bros. had the good sense to hand the universe over to Shrio Games for a Dune-themed RTS. Shrio’s previous project, Northgard, borrowed liberally from Age of Empires as it allowed players to marshal Viking bands through the verdant wilderness of the arctic rim. The warring factions of Arrakis are translated beautifully into Spice Wars’ design philosophy; House Atreides and House Harkonnen clash in the wasteland, and players race to consolidate every dash of melange and spritz of water they can get their hands on to keep the war machine afloat. Of course, <a href=#>Sandworms are a constant threat </a>and answer to no master. There’s always a chance that one of your battalions will be swallowed whole, sending your game plan back to square one. It’s brutal, ornery, unfair, and quintessentially Dune.

You awake in an abandoned cubicle, haunted by a kindly, omnipresent narrator who annotates your various feeble adventures within the white-out drudgery of corporate life. The goal is to, effectively, break the game, and subvert the one-way conveyor belt that comprises the average linear, single-player campaign. Ultra Deluxe is the first time The Stanley Parable has come to consoles, and it adds enough new content to effectively double the initial offering. As always, expect the narrative to be bitingly self-referential and extraordinarily mordant — especially now that it has a chance to be in constant conversation with the original. How do you create a sequel to a game that was already so prickly to the touch?

The game brought Machiavellian concepts like permadeath and no save points from the dankest niches of PC gaming to the front page of the Steam charts. Rogue Legacy 2 enters a gaming ecosystem where countless other developers have iterated upon its original doctrines, and the series graciously integrates many of those modernizations. Rogue Legacy 2 now has a wide array of unique classes, a la <a href=#>Hades</a>, and a strong emphasis on environmental diversity, like Minecraft or Dead Cells. Best of all, the game holds onto the core gimmick that initially made me fall in love with the series. After a character dies, you wrest control of one of their direct descendants, who is beset with all sorts of congenital boons or curses. (You might have quick-feet, but you suffer from colorblindness.) It’s like a paperback fantasy serial stretched out to its tropiest extremes; just an endless series of sons and daughters avenging mothers and fathers.

Saber Interactive distills all the gory thrills of the films into a tight, highly asymmetrical multiplayer experience. Four players take control of various Necronomicon-brandishing heroes, (Ash Williams, Henry The Red, and so on,) while a fifth commands a literal Army of Darkness. It’s a blast to survive by the skin of your teeth, but I have more fun taking the reins of a cruel dungeon master. You summon chittering demons from the gates of hell, who maraud around the map claiming the souls of your victims one by one. At certain junctures, you can even possess one of the heroes, turning their weapons against the team.

Six people died in the flames, and the goal is to survey the dimensional feedback that led up to this tragedy and edit a few choices made by the residents in order to forge a timeline where they get out alive. Most of the gameplay in Eternal Threads is spent scrolling through a week’s worth of arguments, secrets, seductions, and heart-to-hearts, and watching those conversations play out on screen as you uncover two mysteries at once. How did this house burn down? And what, exactly, are all these people hiding? The premise hooked me immediately, if only because Eternal Threads allows us to indulge in a fantastic bit of kindness.

This is one of the most esteemed PC franchises of all time pivoting to a mobile-first, microtransaction-heavy model — at a moment where the corporate image of Blizzard is in total <a href=#>freefall</a>. Many of those concerns remain valid, but nothing can change the fact that Immortal feels shockingly intuitive on an iPhone. The demon hunter’s crossbow bolts stream across the screen with the flick of the index finger; wizards call forth arcane storms with a fidelity that almost rivals a mouse and keyboard. The game packs a full dungeoneering motif. You can party up with friends and delve into accursed catacombs — just like you did in 1999 — and allow the loot-lust to take over your life. Diablo Immortal will not save Blizzard’s reputation, but it is pretty cool to explore Sanctuary on the train.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=g7O7pH data-merchant-id=187020 data-track-name="Diablo Immortal" data-track-option=name data-track-merchant="Apple App Store" data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=0 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>Diablo Immortal</span></a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=g7O7pH data-merchant-id=187020 data-track-name="Diablo Immortal" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant="Apple App Store" data-track-manufacturer data-track-price data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true>Free at Apple App Store Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - custom second buy button" data-track-id=g7O7pH data-merchant-id=187021 data-track-name="Diablo Immortal" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant="Google Play" data-track-manufacturer data-track-price data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true>Free at Google Play Buy</a><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl45zh8ez003o3f7dzw8ywub3@published>Card Shark (MacOS, Nintendo Switch, Windows PC)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/b5a/975/436d3225900b707284d6f1aaf7001f4a06-dnf-duel.rhorizontal.w700.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl45zj1on00503f7db7vz9g6j@published data-word-count=189>We’re in the middle of a digital card game boom, and the best ones on the market — Hearthstone, Slay The Spire, Legends of Runeterra — all essentially ape the formula established by Magic The Gathering in 1993. There’s a lot of math, a lot of keywords, and a lot of tempo swings back and forth before someone with a superior deck, or a superior brain, sends you back to the matchmaking queue. Nerial’s Card Shark, on the other hand, evokes an entirely different philosophy. You’re a 17th-century peasant on a quest to cheat the gentry out of their unearned shillings, and you’ll accomplish that with the ancient art of sleight of hand. Thumb through the deck, feel for the aces, and cut them to the top of the deck. Pour a glass of wine to get a quick peek at whatever your adversary is holding. Screw up, and it’s straight to jail. Card Shark understands that the best part of poker is manipulating the other people at the table, rather than staring down at whatever you happen to be holding. Let’s hope Nerial gets the Rounders license next.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=XrlAUe data-merchant-id=187019 data-track-name="Card Shark" data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Steam data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=19.99 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>Card Shark</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$20</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$20</span> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=XrlAUe data-merchant-id=187019 data-track-name="Card Shark" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Steam data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=19.99 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true>Buy at Steam Buy</a><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl46036m600b03f7dlslsvqea@published>The Quarry (PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series S/X)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/bf7/86e/ffd014c16ea6a2d2ebf3d4b9e6b7e6debd-cuphead.rhorizontal.w700.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl4604unb00cg3f7dh7c450b4@published data-word-count=154>Supermassive Games made its bones with 2015’s Until Dawn — a gristly slasher-flick pastiche in which you escort a cadre of idiot 20-somethings to their untimely deaths. The Quarry is essentially the game’s spiritual successor. This time, we’re in charge of a group of teenagers attempting to survive the night at a moonlit summer camp, and to nobody’s surprise, the action goes off the rails quickly. The Quarry unfolds like an interactive drama. You dictate the choices of characters over a series of daisy-chained cutscenes and watch as they inevitably meet some sort of terrible, midnight-movie end. It’s cheesy, hematic, and graciously unpretentious. Some horror games want to clue the audience in on its big ideas about the cosmic fallacies of morality, and some just want to toss your body on a meathook. Both are vital in their own way, but in the sublime early days of summer, The Quarry hits the perfect tone.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=pjF19T data-merchant-id=187022 data-track-name="The Quarry" data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer=2K data-track-price=20 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>The Quarry</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$20</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$20</span> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=pjF19T data-merchant-id=187022 data-track-name="The Quarry" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=20 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true>Buy at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class="product-buy-link narrativ-link" data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - narrativ button" data-track-id=pjF19T data-merchant-id=187022 data-track-name="The Quarry" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=20 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$20</span> at Amazon Buy</a><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl5k1q4u3006o3b7j2pni3odo@published>DNF Duel (PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/0e0/33d/1c6554a85c8dbe7aa309b260a5b40839b0-symphony-of-war.rhorizontal.w700.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl5k1tqgp007h3b7jx5im86t9@published data-word-count=202>Arc System Works has built a legacy on some of the most visually stunning fighting games of all time. Five years ago it released a beefy, bruising tribute to the Toriyama estate in the form of Dragon Ball FighterZ, and now it’s back with a take on a media franchise that has gone almost entirely unplayed in the west. Dungeon & Fighter is a massively popular RPG in South Korea, and Arc System Works has been tasked with injecting the series into a throwback, Street Fighter facsimile. But you won’t need to fret about the canonical touchstones you’re missing, because it’s incredible to watch DNF Duel in motion. Beams of crackling neon energy pour out of the combatants; bang out a super move, and you’ll be interrupted with a brief anime cutaway — some celestial fighter taking to the air and raining hellfire from above in a stunning coup de grace. DNF Duel pares down its control scheme to the most basic inputs; nobody is expected to master any esoteric joystick motions. That means this is an Arc System Works product that is genuinely approachable to newcomers, which is a reform that the fighting-game genre has needed for a very long time.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=v0X7YV data-merchant-id=189598 data-track-name="DNF Duel" data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Koei Tecmo" data-track-price=22 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>DNF Duel</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$22</span> $25<span> now 12% off</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$22</span> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=v0X7YV data-merchant-id=189598 data-track-name="DNF Duel" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=22 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true>Buy at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - custom second buy button" data-track-id=v0X7YV data-merchant-id=189599 data-track-name="DNF Duel" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Steam data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=49.99 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$50</span> at Steam Buy</a><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl5k2s23r00h13b7jlz9baq51@published>Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course (Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Windows PC)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/d6e/435/7f1442b37be3e8534c23c11ef8f137065c-raft-.rhorizontal.w700.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl5k2tuei00ir3b7jlvp8kc2i@published data-word-count=134>Cuphead languished in development for ages, because like the Merrie Melodies classics it was aping, it takes a long time to knit together zillions of hand-drawn animation cels — particularly when they’re stretched across a ten-hour video game.

For Symphony of War, the touchstone is the early turn-based Fire Emblem RPGs on the Super Nintendo. You are given a flat, top-down map — populated by manicured sprites and tastefully beautified 16-bit terrain — and you are constantly campaigning against the rival kingdoms jostling for power. The new wrinkle introduced by studio Dancing Dragon Games is a de-emphasis on individual units. You will not be deploying an outrageously potent collection of individual anime heroes who can destroy an entire battalion with one swing of their sword. Instead, you’ll be outfitting a raiding party of squads composed of a wide variety of units who are greater than the sum of their parts. This gives the player a much higher degree of creativity as they shape their warforce. Maybe you dedicate one squad to be a training operation for soldiers who show potential for upper management? Maybe you devise a perfect blend of strengths that can absolutely decimate the munitions favored by your rival? It’s a brilliant idea — let’s hope Symphony of War sinks into the DNA of the genre.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=il7YVW data-merchant-id=190893 data-track-name="Symphony of War: The Nephilim Saga" data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Steam data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=19.99 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>Symphony of War: The Nephilim Saga</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$20</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$20</span> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=il7YVW data-merchant-id=190893 data-track-name="Symphony of War: The Nephilim Saga" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Steam data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=19.99 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true>Buy at Steam Buy</a><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl6f4nd0e01h43b7noazs8l26@published>Raft (Windows PC)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/b32/2d9/1203aa9a19b1d835ab9943a4a219c71c74-live-a-live.rhorizontal.w700.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl6f4s0qe01iy3b7nwkp8n8g3@published data-word-count=123>Survival games have experimented with so many different wild permutations over the last ten years, but I appreciate the simplicity of Raft.

Square Enix released it exclusively in Japan and never translated or localized it for western markets. It grew in renown among collectors because of its fascinating premise: The player would navigate through eight vignettes told in different time periods and genre pastiche — a sci-fi tale, a shinobi story, a caveman saga, and so on. Thankfully, Square has amended the record with this gorgeous remake, finally available in English. The muted graphics of the original have been revamped with a resonant blend of 2-D and 3-D, which pleats these landscapes deep into your screen. The combat has retained its grid-based tactical intrigue, which is just as relevant in 2022 as it was in 1994. After the long wait, it’s a blessing to have Live a Live in our hands. Now if only Nintendo could release the other RPG classics that never made it over to America.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=B4gT7J data-merchant-id=190909 data-track-name="Live A Live" data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer=Nintendo data-track-price=50 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>Live A Live</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$50</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$50</span> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=B4gT7J data-merchant-id=190909 data-track-name="Live A Live" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=50 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true>Buy at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class="product-buy-link narrativ-link" data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - narrativ button" data-track-id=B4gT7J data-merchant-id=190909 data-track-name="Live A Live" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=50 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$50</span> at Amazon Buy</a><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl7ql05zr00iy3b6vmf8g17ux@published>Bear and Breakfast (Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/3df/74a/d4b5faae05da3451faf5ecafd3181fa3d5-two-point-campus.rhorizontal.w700.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl7ql0fl400ld3b6v8ygeoqp0@published data-word-count=125>Video games have pushed us on adventures to save the world, rescue princesses, and avenge our fathers, but in<strong> </strong>Bear and Breakfast, we just want to make sure that our humble woodland hotel is running smoothly.<strong> </strong>You play as a bear named Hank, and it’s your job to renovate abandoned log cabins to host our human guests and take their hard-earned cash.<strong> </strong>Bear and Breakfast is designed within the lineage of<strong> </strong>Stardew Valley and My Time at Portia;<strong> </strong>coziness is the prime directive, and this is a game to cuddle up with as the leaves change.

This is a taut, multiplayer-only first-person shooter — players march under the banner of the Austro-Hungarian Empire or the Kingdom of Italy — where battles are won and lost with single-shot rifles and pugilistic trench beatdowns. But unlike some of the steelier military sims on the market, Isonzo is wondrously pulpy and surprisingly approachable. A swig of a canteen probably didn’t do much for the battalions of 1916, but in Blackmill’s world, it can give you a useful stamina boost. It’s playing fast and loose with history; I doubt the actual conscripts of the struggle could equip a perk to reduce their weapon sway. It’s all the World War I pomp and circumstance filtered through the prism of Call of Duty. No trench foot.

The design legend’s indomitable run of adventure games in the early ’90s — Day of the Tentacle, Maniac Mansion, and of course, The Secret of Monkey Island — possessed lyrical dialogue, brilliantly moody art direction, and the sort of swashbuckling adventurous spirit that was genuinely Pixar-worthy if he was working in movies. Still, the idea of Gilbert coming home to his most beloved work, decades later, had a slight air of bitter nostalgia. Could he really find the magic again? Reader, he hasn’t lost a step. Return to Monkey Island is the sixth game in the series, and if you’ve never taken the journey before, expect a point-and-click journey through an eccentric, cockeyed interpretation of the age of piracy — the Caribbean bustling with used car salesmen, discount voodoo shops, and a handful of puzzles that are always tough, but never unfair. The star of the show, as always, is Guybrush Threepwood: a cheery, quippy, wannabe pirate at the heart of the fiction, who has a Frodo-like propensity to stumble into ancient cults and eldritch blood rituals. We’re happy he’s back. The video game industry is better off when Ron Gilbert is at the peak of his powers.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=hzKSnj data-merchant-id=195560 data-track-name="Return To Monkey Island" data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Steam data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=24.99 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>Return To Monkey Island</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$25</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$25</span> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=hzKSnj data-merchant-id=195560 data-track-name="Return To Monkey Island" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Steam data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=24.99 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true>Buy at Steam Buy</a><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl8x89wzj00by3b6w92r5o2kn@published>Grounded (Microsoft Windows, Xbox One, Xbox Series X and Series S)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/a54/ea3/e197fd9221fccb76965d6f311fe3c8f1eb-A-Plague-Tale-Requiem.rhorizontal.w700.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl8x8cac400ei3b6w2hk9sv9a@published data-word-count=173>Survival games love to throw players into brutal conditions. I’ve been marooned along the frozen reaches of the Canadian arctic in The Long Dark and guarded a homestead from marauding greylings in Valheim, but Grounded shifts the setting to a much more familiar environment. We are a collection of grade-school ne’er-do-wells who’ve been shrunken down to ant dimensions by some sort of accidental sci-fi mishap. Now, either alone or in a group, you must forage for food and spindle together a shelter in the most challenging of all climates; the average suburban backyard. Like most survival games, Grounded has you scrounging together whatever resources you can find in order to forge them into munitions, infrastructure, and rations — but instead of toppling ancient oak trees and fending off flesh-eating zombies, you’ll be working with some incredibly meager, cul-de-sac supplies. (Blades of grass, grains of sand, maybe a shred of lint, if you’re lucky.) It all gives Grounded a delightful, Nickelodeon-ish verve; as if you and your friends are role-playing your own made-for-TV movie.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=qbtTPT data-merchant-id=195523 data-track-name=Grounded data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Steam data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=39.99 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>Grounded</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$40</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$40</span> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=qbtTPT data-merchant-id=195523 data-track-name=Grounded data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Steam data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=39.99 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true>Buy at Steam Buy</a><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cla1c7xew00d93b6s09mx6x76@published>Scorn (Microsoft Windows, Xbox Series X/S)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/6a4/f3f/e3a059526ba52ee385a74d40f0629755ea-Mario-Rabbids-Sparks-of-Hope.rhorizontal.w700.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cla1cieq700hi3b6szr37r9ym@published data-word-count=112>Scorn is ugly by nature. The first-person shooter celebrates the gross, gothic single-player dirges of the ’90s — like Doom or Heretic. You play a nameless, faceless husk trapped in an unforgiving wasteland with a vague objective to figure out what went so wrong on this long-abandoned planet. The upstart Serbian studio Ebb Software nails its one-of-a-kind art design. An ominous purple mist chokes the rotting desert that sprawls out between blackened industrial plants, and the corridors inside are knotted with sinewy, pulsating organic matter. You’ll have plenty of puzzles to solve and interdimensional horrors to dispatch inside the mazes, but Scorn is to be experienced for its vibes before anything else.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=VR0Rcd data-merchant-id=198449 data-track-name="Scorn " data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Steam data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=39.99 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>Scorn</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$40</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$40</span> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=VR0Rcd data-merchant-id=198449 data-track-name="Scorn " data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Steam data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=39.99 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true>Buy at Steam Buy</a><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cla1ctqnw00kq3b6sogoq3ry5@published>A Plague Tale: Requiem (PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Series S, Nintendo Switch, Microsoft Windows, Xbox Cloud Gaming)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/c9b/dec/b3060acb6cda388e1cf328ce5c77f88baa-Bayonetta-3.rhorizontal.w700.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cla1ctwpe00m73b6suvj04kgi@published data-word-count=129>It’s always a joy to see a studio stumble into a surprise hit and suddenly be blessed with the resources to truly nail its vision in the sequel. A Plague Tale: Innocence arrived in 2019 with a clever — if occasionally janky — set of stealth-action puzzles and a delightfully downcast Middle Ages veneer. (You frequently would be asked to avoid a horde of diseased rats. It was pretty gnarly.) Requiem gives that premise far more oxygen with larger levels, a more devious arsenal, and a genuinely startling graphical advance — medieval France has never looked better. But best of all is the storytelling, which somehow manages to ground this gothic nightmare in the human beings who need to survive it — one swarm of vermin at a time.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=KYiJfo data-merchant-id=198455 data-track-name="A Plague Tale: Requiem" data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Steam data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=49.99 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>A Plague Tale: Requiem</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$50</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$50</span> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=KYiJfo data-merchant-id=198455 data-track-name="A Plague Tale: Requiem" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Steam data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=49.99 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true>Buy at Steam Buy</a><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cla1d5a7000r43b6scm606jiu@published>Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope (Nintendo Switch)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cla1d5v0z00u63b6sc9lny4pr@published data-word-count=154>Nintendo rarely lets other video-game companies play with its toys, so it was pretty surprising when the Switch was unveiled in 2017 with … a Ubisoft-developed Mario game? In which the denizens of the Mushroom Kingdom engaged in tactical, turn-based strategy with the mediocre Rabbids franchise? It was even more shocking that Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle turned out to be good, and this year’s sequel is even better. Sparks of Hope is the best tactics game of 2022. The synergies and combos you can find on these war fronts rival your best XCOM turns. You can bounce one of the members of your squadron off of another dormant character, putting them in perfect flanking position. You can unlock floating sidekicks who grant a whole new slate of abilities. You can build out a Luigi like he’s a League of Legends champion. Sparks of Hope is a roaring success.

As you orchestrate combos, that hair unspools and morphs into nightmarish beasts that bolster your damage output. The premise is so ridiculous and politically fraught that it seemed unlikely the character’s namesake series would ever catch on among a discerning video-game audience, and yet people were absolutely parched for more Bayonetta after its eight-year hiatus. Bayonetta 3 keeps the series’ scintillating, whip-smart combat system, but PlatinumGames mixes in a number of interesting wrinkles for franchise veterans. For instance, Bayonetta can now summon a litany of demons to fight by her side like an Amazonian Pokémon trainer. There’s a new playable character in the mix, Viola, a punk-rock witch who’s equipped with a samurai sword that can transform into a gigantic, carnivorous cat named Chesire. It’s all proudly over the top, which is to say that Bayonetta hasn’t lost a step.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=Ifa9Bt data-merchant-id=198436 data-track-name="Bayonetta 3" data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer=Nintendo data-track-price=44 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>Bayonetta 3</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$44</span> $60<span> now 27% off</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$44</span> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=Ifa9Bt data-merchant-id=198436 data-track-name="Bayonetta 3" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=44 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true>Buy at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class="product-buy-link narrativ-link" data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - narrativ button" data-track-id=Ifa9Bt data-merchant-id=198436 data-track-name="Bayonetta 3" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=44 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$44</span> at Amazon Buy</a><p class=subscriber-copy>Thank you for subscribing and supporting our journalism<span id=givenName></span>.
