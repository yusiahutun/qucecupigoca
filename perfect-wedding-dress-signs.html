Countless films and TV shows tell us that anything less than a big display of emotion indicates that you should carry on the search. This gives us unrealistic expectations of what we should be aiming to feel, but, as any skilled bridal designer or expert will confirm, it’s often the quieter signs brides make when they’ve found the dress they want to marry in that carry real weight. A mix of non-verbal acts and tells give us away; a subtle language between the bride and the designer. You might not know you’ve found the perfect wedding dress yet, but the expert standing next to you in the boutique probably already has a clear idea.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"There’s often a lot of swooshing that goes on"<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“It’s simply a result of years of experience working with women and interpreting what they say – and, more often, what they don’t say – and always being one step ahead,” says Kate Halfpenny of Halfpenny London, whose bridal clients have included Emilia Fox and Ophelia Lovibond. “We’re always listening and so much is said during those moments of silence to give us a clue what the bride wants. We’re like detectives.”</p><img alt="halfpenny london wedding dress" title="Halfpenny London wedding dress" width=914 height=1380 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screenshot-2024-04-18-at-14-16-16-66211d4028ff5.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">LEAH MARIE PHOTOGRAPHY</span><p>Halfpenny London</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As someone who has only recently sought and found my perfect wedding dress, I can attest that it’s only when you start trying things on that you really know – or rather when you really feel. You can have as many preconceived ideas as you like, but it’s only when you feel the fabric against you, experience how it moves, and see the way something looks on you that you truly gain clarity. Often, we don’t know know what we want until someone opens our mind to new ideas and takes us out of our comfort zone. Sometimes it takes an expert – someone who sees and hears us – to make us feel like the best version of ourselves. Bridal designers and stylists often know a client has found the perfect dress before she does herself.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We spoke to three bridal experts to find out the tacit signs you’re making that show them that the wedding-dress search is over.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">The shoulder drop</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“More often than not, a bride's body language relaxes, their shoulders drop and they start moving around in the dress – we’ve seen some women practise a dance move,” says Amelia Tompkins of <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://lovestorylondon.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Love Story London" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Love Story London</a>.

"You really see their whole face light up when it is ‘the dress’, which is such a special moment. As they fall in love, clients will touch the fabric more and really get a feel for how it will wear on the day. For so many women, their wedding dress is the most important dress they’ll ever wear. I believe it should be the very, very, very best dress that a woman has ever worn, and it’s a huge privilege to be a part of that experience.”</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Joyful relief</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“The search for a wedding dress can be exhausting,” says <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.net-a-porter.com/en-gb/shop/designer/jenny-packham?facet=ads_f11503_ntk_cs%253A%2522White%2522" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jenny Packham" data-vars-ga-product-id=066641fb-68fd-461c-9228-245fe2ddc797 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href="https://www.net-a-porter.com/en-gb/shop/designer/jenny-packham?facet=ads_f11503_ntk_cs%253A%2522White%2522" data-product-url="https://www.net-a-porter.com/en-gb/shop/designer/jenny-packham?facet=ads_f11503_ntk_cs%253A%2522White%2522" data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.net-a-porter.com%2Fen-gb%2Fshop%2Fdesigner%2Fjenny-packham%3Ffacet%3Dads_f11503_ntk_cs%253A%2522White%2522" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=2512ad25-8532-4579-aaf0-126c7a8d7f6a class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Jenny Packham</a>. “The dazzling array of white can be overwhelming. Victorian swooning is not the style of a JP bride; the dress is just part of their day and, while it is important, it's just one of the many decisions they must make to create their perfect wedding.

Sometimes she needs a moment to take it in and process what she’s seeing in the mirror. Don’t worry if you don’t have that 'big moment' where you burst into tears as that’s often completely irrelevant. If you love how you feel in that dress, it’s 100 per cent 'The One.'”</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwrsCzmJqqXZe%2FqrDErGaabmBqgHWFkXFmqZ2im7KkwIywnJ2cmaO0brDRnqqsZaOetK%2B%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./fixer-upper-joanna-gaines-home-texas-beautiful-glimpse-inside-living-room.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Joanna Gaines provides beautiful peek inside home shared with husband Chip and five children</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./grand-ole-opry-star-rollin-sullivan-dead-at-93.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Grand Ole Opry Star Rollin Sullivan Dead At 93</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amal-clooney-mob-wife-trend-cream-fur-coat.html>Amal Clooney Elevates the Mob Wife Trend in a Cream Fur Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./demolition-underway-at-washington-elementary-davenport.html>Demolition underway at Washington Elementary, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iowa-man-killed-in-head-on-crash.html>Iowa man killed in head-on crash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./style-edit-richard-milles-technically-ambitious-new-rm-30-01-automatic-luxury-watch-was-inspired.html>Style Edit: Richard Milles technically ambitious new RM 30-01 Automatic luxury watch was inspired</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./463481-what-happened-frankie-lons-life-story-death.html>What happened to Frankie Lons?
