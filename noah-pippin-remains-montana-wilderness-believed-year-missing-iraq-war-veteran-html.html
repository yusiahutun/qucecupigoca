veteran Noah Pippin disappeared two years ago</p><p><span>Human remains have been found in the Bob Marshall Wilderness in northwest Montana, where a team has been searching for an Iraq war veteran who disappeared two years ago, a sheriff said Friday.</span></p><p><span>About a month before he was last seen, Noah Pippin quit his job with the Los Angeles Police Department where he worked after serving with the Marines in Iraq.<br></span></p><p><span>He later went to visit his family in Michigan and told them he was heading back west to serve with the California National Guard. </span><span>Instead, he drove a rental car to Montana.</span></p><p><span>Hikers reported seeing Pippin heading into the wilderness ill-prepared for a long stay in the wild and apparently on-edge.<br></span></p><p><span>He was never seen again.<br></span></p><p><span>The parents of Noah Pippin released a statement Friday saying Lewis and Clark County sheriff's and coroner's officials told them remains had been found in the Burnt Creek area.<br></span></p><p><span>Authorities haven't confirmed the identity of the remains yet, but Mike and Rosalie Pippin said there is a strong likelihood they belong to their son.</span></p><p><span>'Noah's remains are almost 98% positively identified as having been found. Thank you to all you sweet and wonderful people who have held us up in prayer and expressed your caring over the last 2 years,' the family wrote on a Facebook page for their missing son.<br></span></p><p><span>A search party of border agents, search and rescue officials, a sheriff's deputy and volunteers found the remains and planned to bring them back to the state crime lab in Missoula. Coroner M.E. 'Mickey' Nelson said it could be several days or even weeks before the body can be positively identified.</span></p><p><span>'There was enough circumstantial evidence that I felt comfortable, and I informed the family, that their loved one has been located, based on preliminary indicators and circumstantial things we found,' Nelson said. He declined to elaborate on what was found.</span></p><p style=font-weight:700><span>Scroll down for video</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/08/25/article-2193449-14AFCFD6000005DC-484_634x458.jpg height=458 width=634 alt="Family's prayers: Noah Pippin's parents, his mother pictured beside him, released a statement on Friday announcing the remains' recovery but said they have not been positively identified as his" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Family's prayers: Noah Pippin's parents, his mother pictured beside him, released a statement on Friday announcing the remains' recovery but said they have not been positively identified as his</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/08/25/article-2193449-14AFCFE0000005DC-103_634x414.jpg height=414 width=634 alt="Disappearance: The remains had been found in the Burnt Creek area that is part of the Bob Marshall Wilderness south of Glacier National Park, pictured" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Disappearance: The remains had been found in the Burnt Creek area that is part of the Bob Marshall Wilderness south of Glacier National Park, pictured</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/08/25/article-2193449-14AFCFD2000005DC-225_306x423.jpg height=423 width=306 alt="Missing: Noah Pippin, described as a giant but polite man with a shaved head, was last seen on September 15 of 2010 by hikers" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Missing: Noah Pippin, described as a giant but polite man with a shaved head, was last seen on September 15 of 2010 by hikers</p><p><span>Nelson said animals appeared to have gotten to the body, but there was no indication yet of how the person died or when.
