He has been <a href=#>seen in fits of laughter</a> at Dame Eden’s Royal Variety performance and is no stranger to having banter with his family. However, at first, one particular joke at an event with <a href=#>Prince William</a> seemed to throw the monarch and he looked rather horrified.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-king-charles-is-called-buff-and-prince-william-can-t-help-but-laugh>King Charles is called ‘buff’ and Prince William can’t help but laugh</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>King Charles and Prince William were speaking at an engagement where the king was handing over the residency of the British Sub-Aqua Club to his son. Before they spoke, a clip uploaded to the <a href=#>royal</a> family’s YouTube channel shows Charles being described as having “buff credentials.”</p><p>British Sub-Aqua Club’s chairman Eugene Farrell explained: “At our office when we were looking at the picture, I heard you describe that picture as being ‘rather buff,'” which caused those in the room to laugh and the sovereign to look quite uncomfortable. “A term of endearment I believe,” he added.</p><p>Prince William can be seen grinning and laughing at the remark as he watches his dad be unsure of how to react.</p><p>Later, in his speech, the king said: I do hope the club will go from strength to strength under its new and enthusiastic management. And I know that my eldest will now demonstrate his buff credentials.</p><p>William, 42, then said he was “proud” to overtake the presidency and before clips showed him going for a swim in a pool.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-charles-and-william-joke-about-his-sausage-fingers>Charles and William joke about his ‘sausage fingers’</h2><p>In a BBC special about King Charles’ coronation that aired at Christmas, Prince William and his dad can be seen having a joke about his fingers, which has often generated conversations on social media platforms such as X (formerly <a href=#>Twitter</a>). While rehearsing the ceremony, the future king can be seen trying to do up the clasp on his dad’s big robe and quips: “On the day, that’s not going to go in.” With a smile, his dad tells him: “No, you haven’t got sausage fingers like mine.”</p><p>The king suffers from a condition called Dactylitis, informally known as “sausage fingers.”</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">According to</a> Healthline, the condition happens “due to inflammation known as tenosynovitis. This means that, unlike typical joint swelling that only affects the knuckle of a finger or toe, dactylitis causes inflammation of your entire finger or toe.”</p><p>The site explains a person’s condition can become so bad a person can no longer make a fist.</p><p><strong>SO BRAVE: </strong><a href=#>Why King Charles chose to update fans on cancer news</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2aDcLfIp55mm5iWv62x0majqKebmrFutM6rqaKemZqxbsPHnqVmq5%2BisrC6xGahqKOVmXqpsYyhmJ1lkqqzp3nCq5ydnZ6ptqK40mg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./488164-meet-khaza-kamil-gates-quick-facts-photos-kevin-gates-son.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Meet Khaza Kamil Gates: Quick facts and photos of Kevin Gates' son</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./661abb1e22601d747e8b4587-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fernando Alonso rompera rcord de hace 51 aos en F1</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amal-clooney-mob-wife-trend-cream-fur-coat.html>Amal Clooney Elevates the Mob Wife Trend in a Cream Fur Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./demolition-underway-at-washington-elementary-davenport.html>Demolition underway at Washington Elementary, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iowa-man-killed-in-head-on-crash.html>Iowa man killed in head-on crash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./style-edit-richard-milles-technically-ambitious-new-rm-30-01-automatic-luxury-watch-was-inspired.html>Style Edit: Richard Milles technically ambitious new RM 30-01 Automatic luxury watch was inspired</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./463481-what-happened-frankie-lons-life-story-death.html>What happened to Frankie Lons?
