A decade later on August 2, 2016, the US Air Force declared its first squadron of F-35A fighters combat ready. The fifth-generation combat aircraft is designed to perform ground attack and air defence missions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The J-20 stealth fighter was first unveiled in 2011. It made its first public flight at an air show in the southern city of Zhuhai in November this year. It is believed to be China’s most advanced fighter under development by the nation’s military.</p><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0">Watch: J-20’s debut in Zhuhai</h4><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0">How do they look and what are their specifications?</h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The F-35 is a single-seat, single-engine, all-weather stealth multi-role fighter.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It was designed to be America’s “premier surface-to-air missile killer and is uniquely equipped for this mission with cutting-edge processing power, synthetic aperture radar integration techniques and advanced target recognition,” according to Mark Shackelford, acquisition deputy to the assistant secretary of the US Air Force.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The F-35 is intended to have close- and long-range air-to-air capability and has the advantage over the F-22 – a tactical fighter jet – in basing flexibility and advanced sensors and information fusion, according to Lockheed Martin.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/660x385/public/images/methode/2016/12/14/7227f1a2-c1c8-11e6-85c8-a5c9105fe082_660x385.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/660x385/public/images/methode/2016/12/14/593005f4-c1cd-11e6-85c8-a5c9105fe082_660x385.JPG?itok=UaLEKrVL"><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The J-20, China’s latest-generation fighter jet, is a single-seat aircraft with two engines, forward canards and a stealthy profile.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It has a long, broad fuselage for internal weapons and fuel storage, and appears to have three internal weapons bays – two smaller bays for short-range missiles and one larger bay for long range air-to-air missiles and air-to-ground ordnance.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Compared to the US’s fifth-generation fighter jets, the J-20 has longer range, more internal fuel capacity and larger internal weapons capability, said Justin Bronk, a research fellow specialising in combat air power at the Royal United Services Institute, in November.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Many specifics of the new weapon remain unknown as the Chinese military is reluctant to provide details of the J-20, possibly because some of its key components might not be finished or entirely originate from China.</p><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0">How do the jets fare in terms of stealth technology and other features?</h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Unlike the US’ previous generations of fighter jets, the F-35 was designed for stealth. It is shaped and made using radar-absorbent material that is both more durable and requires less maintenance than its predecessors.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But, like other stealth fighters, the F-35 is still susceptible to detection by low-frequency radar, such as those used by civilian air traffic control, according to Defence Aviation, an aerospace and defence</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">analysis website. Low-frequency radars, however, do not provide detailed enough coordinates to guide a missile onto target.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The J-20’s nose and canopy use a stealth shaping design similar to that of the F-22. The J-20 hence rates well in terms of stealth performance on its front, but its sides and axisymmetric engine nozzles risk exposing it to radar, according to a preliminary report by Air Power Australia, an independent defence think tank.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">An observer at the Airshow China 2016 in November also said after the J-20’s flypast that it was very loud, Reuters reported.</p><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0">How much does each jet cost?</h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There are three types of F-35 aircraft, the cheapest being the F-35A, whose recently contracted unit cost is US$98 million per unit without an engine, and will be lowered to US$85 million when in full production, according to the official website of the F-35 Lightning II.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 2014, the Pentagon’s chief weapons buyer Frank Kendall was quoted by CBS News’ 60 Minutes as saying that the F-35 programme had gone “US$163 billion over budget [and was] seven years behind schedule”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">More recently, Pentagon officials said they needed an additional US$500 million to finish developing the jets. Deliveries of the F-35 for the US military are scheduled for completion in 2037, with a projected service life of up to 2070.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Pentagon has been wrangling with Lockheed over the price of the latest batch of planes, according to a New York Times report on Monday.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/660x385/public/images/methode/2016/12/14/620bfe20-c1ce-11e6-85c8-a5c9105fe082_660x385.JPG?itok=Xf-yjZKO"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/660x385/public/images/methode/2016/12/14/f5014f38-c1c8-11e6-85c8-a5c9105fe082_660x385.JPG?itok=FsFQoF1n"><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The price of Chinese self-developed military weapon is normally one-fifth to one-third of the price of a similar US weapon. And the purchase price of a military weapon is 5 per cent bigger than the real cost,” said military observer Zhou Chenming.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Zhou – who used to work for a subsidiary of the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, the main state-owned contractor for Beijing’s space programme – is now a researcher at the Knowfar Institute for Strategic and Defence Studies, a non-governmental think tank in Jiangyin, Jiangsu province.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The J-20 corresponds to the F-22,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The unit cost of F-22 is $ 150 million, according to U.S. Air Force’s 2011 budget estimate.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Using Zhou’s formula, this indicates the price of a J-20 would fall between US$30 million and US$50 million per unit.</p><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0">What are the strategic implications of the development of the jets?</h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The F-35 programme can be seen as a diplomatic tool to enhance US security networks. Israel, for example, has ordered 33 of the stealth fighters at a cost of more than US$5.5 billion, and the Israeli cabinet decided recently to increase the number of planes to 50.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The jet was also regarded as a robust engine of economic growth for the US and its international partners, according to Lockheed Martin’s executive vice-president Orlando Carvalho in June 2014.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The J-20 is not intended for export. As it will not be for sale in the global market, it is not expected to help boost security ties between China and other countries.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But the weapon is an important milestone in China’s ongoing efforts to develop more advanced military technology. The fact it will not be exported indicates that the aircraft is Beijing’s most advanced fighter under development by its military, analysts have said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The J-20 is the first combat aircraft developed by China that qualifies as “state of the art” by Western measures. It also shows that China has mastered “stealth shaping” technology – an essential prerequisite for developing stealth aircraft.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The J-20 has the potential to alter the regional balance in Asia by rendering nearly all regional air defence systems ineffective.</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: How the top u.s. and Chinese jets stack up</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miaoaGelnyltc%2BlpqaZk656pbHFnqWcnV%2BWv7W1wqWcaGpgaoF1hZFomKadop6wor%2BMn2RsbV2btqi0056pZqKVqXq3v4ycn6Kmkah6q3mRaWSwoJmYtW6uxK2rnqo%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./casey-frey.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Casey Frey - Bio, Career, Age, Net Worth, Height, Nationality, Facts</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./pamac-manjaro-linux-guide.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>A Beginner's Guide to Pamac in Manjaro Linux</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amal-clooney-mob-wife-trend-cream-fur-coat.html>Amal Clooney Elevates the Mob Wife Trend in a Cream Fur Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./demolition-underway-at-washington-elementary-davenport.html>Demolition underway at Washington Elementary, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iowa-man-killed-in-head-on-crash.html>Iowa man killed in head-on crash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./style-edit-richard-milles-technically-ambitious-new-rm-30-01-automatic-luxury-watch-was-inspired.html>Style Edit: Richard Milles technically ambitious new RM 30-01 Automatic luxury watch was inspired</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./463481-what-happened-frankie-lons-life-story-death.html>What happened to Frankie Lons?
