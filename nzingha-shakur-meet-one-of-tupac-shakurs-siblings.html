He had three stepbrothers: Mopreme Shakur, Chinua Shakur, and Ayize Shakur; three half-sisters, Sekyiwa Shakur, Takerra Allen, and Nzingha Shakur.</p><p>They have all come a long way from who they were when they lost their sibling and are all successful now.&nbsp;Some, like Mopreme and Chinua Shakur, became rappers, while others, like Sekyiwa and Takerra Allen, became entrepreneurs and authors.&nbsp;They have all contributed to ensuring that his legacy is never forgotten.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Mutulu-Shakur.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Nzingha_Shakur_Tupac_Shakurs_Stepsister></span>Who Is Nzingha Shakur, Tupac Shakur’s Stepsister?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Nzingha Shakur was born in 1981 in New York, United States, making her 42 years old. Her mother is&nbsp;Makini Shakur, and her father is Mutulu Shakur.&nbsp;</p><p>Including her, Mutulu had three other kids – Sekyiwa, Mopreme, and Chinua. Tupac was also considered his son as he raised him as such after marrying his mom, Afeni Shakur.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, Mutulu was arrested in 1986 for his alleged involvement in a 1981 robbery of a Brinks armored truck. It was a heinous crime that led to the death of three security personnel.&nbsp;</p><p>It led Nzingha’s mother to move her to Texas. She attended high school there and later got accepted at McCurry University.&nbsp;Nzingha graduated with a Sociology and Public Relations degree. Since then, she has held various positions, including an assistant manager at a retail company.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Old_Is_Nzingha_Shakur></span>How Old Is Nzingha Shakur?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tupac’s stepsister, Nzingha Shakur, was born on May 16, 1981.

We also know she once worked as an assistant manager at a retail store, but other than that, her career path is primarily shrouded in secrecy.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Nzingha_Shakur_Instagram></span>Nzingha Shakur Instagram&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tupac’s stepsister, Nzingha, is active on social media.

The shooting occurred at 11:15 p.m. (PDT) when Tupac’s car stopped at a red light at East Flamingo Road and Koval Lane.&nbsp;</p><p>He got hit four times: once in the arm, once in the thigh, and twice in the chest, with one bullet penetrating his right lung.&nbsp;His legacy has been kept alive by his family and extended relatives. Sekyiwa, one of his stepsisters, currently heads the foundation created in his name and has continued to stand in solidarity with black people.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>Tupac</a> and Sekyiwa shared a close bond while he lived, but not much is known about her as she makes it a point to avoid publicity.&nbsp;Their mom, Afeni, has also passed away.
