Ulanzi and Neewer both have wide-angle adapters that provide a 0.75x zoom factor, turning the 24mm lens into an 18mm one. Similar lens adapters exist for many other point-and-shoot cameras, too.</p><p>Here is a handheld shot with the ZV-1 by itself, with no crop from active stabilization. The camera is held with a fully extended arm.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/08/zv-1-example-image-with-no-modifications.jpg><p>Next, we have the ZV-1 with active stabilization enabled and a crop of about 1.3x.

Active stabilization dramatically improves the quality of video footage, but using it adds a crop that makes the camera nearly useless for selfie-style vlogging. Using the adapter makes active stabilization around as wide as shooting without stabilization, improving your options for vlogging.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=neewer-adapter-for-sony-zv-e10-16-50mm-kit-lens>Neewer Adapter for Sony ZV-E10 16-50mm Kit Lens</h3><p>Neewer also has a wide-angle adapter for Sony's 16-50mm APS-C kit lens, most prominently used with the ZV-E10 and a6000 series. It converts the 16mm APS-C focal length to 12mm, or a 24mm full-frame equivalent to 18mm, which is now in the ultra-wide range.</p><p>Here is a handheld vlog shot using the kit lens at 16mm.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/07/reference-handheld-vlog-shot-using-the-sony-16-50mm-lens.jpg><p>Adding the adapter, the handheld vlog shot becomes a much wider 12mm without a noticeable loss in quality.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/07/hanheld-vlog-shot-using-the-neewer-wide-angle-adapter-on-the-sony-16-50mm-kit-lens.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=xenvo-pro-lens-kit-for-smartphones>Xenvo Pro Lens Kit for Smartphones</h3><p>Many phones already have wide-angle lenses, such as the 0.5x lens on many iPhones. However, many phones save the highest quality image sensor for the standard lens, and others don't have wide-angle lenses at all. As such, wide-angle lenses such as the one we're testing by Xenvo for phones can occasionally be useful!</p><p>Here is a handheld selfie shot using an iPhone 12 Pro Max's standard rear lens with a fully extended arm.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/07/reference-shot-using-the-iphone-main-rear-camera.jpeg><p>Next, here is a handheld selfie shot using the iPhone's standard rear lens with a 0.45x wide-angle lens adapter—notice the significant vignetting and fisheye distortion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/07/using-wide-angle-on-iphone-rear-main-camera.jpeg><p>For comparison, we have a handheld selfie shot using the iPhone's built-in wide-angle lens, which is much cleaner than using an adapter and actually appears wider than the adapter's stated 0.45x zoom factor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/07/reference-shot-using-the-iphone-0-5x-rear-camera.jpeg><p>If you already have a smartphone with a wide-angle lens, this adapter isn't particularly useful, but it may help a lot if you're just starting to <a href=#>vlog using an iPhone</a> or another smartphone and need a wider frame.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Conversely, it may be useful if you're using the front camera to obtain a wider shot while being able to preview it. Here is the front camera with the wide-angle adapter, which is much wider than your typical selfie and avoids vignetting if you keep the selfie cropped.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/07/example-of-using-wide-angle-adapter-on-iphone-front-camera.jpeg><p>The front camera has a significantly smaller sensor than the rear cameras and quality-wise is unideal for vlogging. However, if you prefer it because of the ability to preview your shot, a wide-angle lens adapter makes it more versatile.</p><h2 id=the-benefits-of-using-wide-angle-adapters>The Benefits of Using Wide-Angle Adapters</h2><p><a href=#>Wide-angle lenses have numerous perks</a> in photography and video. A wide-angle adapter allows for much more flexibility in framing. As seen with how narrow the ZV-1 is with active stabilization enabled, a wide-angle adapter allows for more literal wiggle room in keeping you properly in-frame on handheld shots.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A wide-angle adapter is almost always much more cost-effective than a dedicated ultra-wide lens. One of the <a href=#>perks of shooting with APS-C cameras over full-frame cameras</a> is cheaper lens options. However, high-quality ultra-wide lenses remain pricey even for APS-C camera bodies, with most Sony options well over $500. The kit lens and adapter combo, on the other hand, is under $250 in total.</p><h2 id=the-wide-angle-adapter-comes-at-a-cost>The Wide-Angle Adapter Comes at a Cost</h2><p>Adding a lens onto an existing lens almost always has some issues. Most prominent of these are reductions in image quality ranging from reduced sharpness, heavy vignetting, glare, and fisheye distortion.</p><p>These issues are most apparent on the smartphone adapters, whereas any quality loss is much more subtle with the Neewer adapters for dedicated cameras. For example, with the Neewer adapter for the Sony 16-50mm lens, we have a photo of a sign with and without the adapter.</p><p>First, here is the image of just the lens zoomed in.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/08/lightroom-reference-shot-of-using-the-sony-16-50mm-lens-without-the-neewer-adapter.jpeg><p>Next, here is a zoomed-in image of that same sign using the adapter—notice how the details on the letters are noticeably less sharp. That said, if you need to zoom in to see the issues, the adapter is certainly usable for vlogging.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/08/lightroom-example-of-the-neewer-wide-angle-for-sony-16-50mm-showing-blurry-details.jpeg><p>While adapters are affordable and, especially with dedicated cameras, can improve your options with few drawbacks, they're an additional thing to carry around and for many, not worth the loss in image quality.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 class="title icon i-list">Key Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Wide-angle lens adapters provide a cost-effective solution to make your existing lens wider, allowing for more flexibility in framing and capturing wider shots.</li><li>Neewer adapters for Sony cameras like the ZV-1 and ZV-E10 offer improved vlogging capabilities, making handheld shots more stable and usable with wider focal lengths.</li><li>While wide-angle adapters can be useful for smartphone vlogging, they may result in reduced image quality, including vignetting, distortion, and reduced sharpness. Consider the trade-off before using them.</li></ul><h2 id=are-wide-angle-adapters-worth-using>Are Wide-Angle Adapters Worth Using?</h2><p>These lens adapters allow you to dramatically widen your shot at a low price. They seem most usable when paired with dedicated cameras, as the drawbacks are minimal while the gained width is truly useful. If you need a wider focal length at an affordable price and can bear the drawbacks of the adapter you use, they are certainly worth at least trying.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGiuoZmkYq6zsYywoJ2dXZa7qLjEZqOepqNirqWtz62cq6tf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-bella-poarch-boyfriend.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Bella Poarch's Boyfriend?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./racism-and-hate-crime-surges-being-asian-american-woman-living-bell.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Opinion | As racism and hate crime surges, being an Asian-American woman is like living in a bell ja</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amal-clooney-mob-wife-trend-cream-fur-coat.html>Amal Clooney Elevates the Mob Wife Trend in a Cream Fur Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./demolition-underway-at-washington-elementary-davenport.html>Demolition underway at Washington Elementary, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iowa-man-killed-in-head-on-crash.html>Iowa man killed in head-on crash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./style-edit-richard-milles-technically-ambitious-new-rm-30-01-automatic-luxury-watch-was-inspired.html>Style Edit: Richard Milles technically ambitious new RM 30-01 Automatic luxury watch was inspired</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./463481-what-happened-frankie-lons-life-story-death.html>What happened to Frankie Lons?
