Pulling no punches, Burnett details Carrie’s youthful struggles with drug addiction and her long, hard journey through rehab and beyond. After successfully emerging from the dark years, Hamilton forged a successful, independent career for herself as both an actress and a writer. Before she died at age 38 of lung cancer, she asked her mother to complete Sunrise to Memphis, the story she had been working on before her illness exacted its final toll. Unable to do so, Burnett came up with an alternative, fashioning an intimate portrait of a sometimes challenging, always loving mother-daughter relationship by combining correspondence from Carrie with her own anecdotes and memories. As a bonus, Burnett provides the unfinished Sunrise to Memphis — a fitting tribute to her talented daughter’s creative life.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/carol-burnett-and-tina-fey.jpg><p>As <a href=#>previously reported by&nbsp;Closer Weekly</a>, the relationship between mother and daughter could be rough during the latter’s teenage years. “She got sober when she was 17,” Carol explained. “I put her in a third rehab place and, oh my God, she&nbsp;hated&nbsp;me. I came to the conclusion that I had to love her enough to let her hate me. She got sober and we started bonding. We wound up working together, writing a play together. We worked together on three shows.”</p><p>According to Deadline, “The film will follow the highs and lows of Burnett’s life as a working mother, actress and producer — all told through her relationship with her daughter Carrie.”</p><p>No production start or release date has been announced as of yet.</p><p>Be sure to check out and <a href=#>subscribe to our Classic TV & Film Podcast</a> for interviews with your favorite stars!&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46cmKunnGKvtr7NnqutZZOWv7O1xGaYp5xdorJuuc6voJ5n</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kira-noir.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Kira Noir dating?
