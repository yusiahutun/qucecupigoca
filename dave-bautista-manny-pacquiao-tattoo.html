More on exactly why the <a href=# style=text-align:start>Glass Onion</a> star feels so passionately about getting inked in a moment. Recently, Dave has spoken out about having former friend <a href=# style=text-align:start>Manny Pacquiao</a>’s team logo removed from his arm.</p><p>The boxer made extremely anti-gay comments, which led Dave to not only cover up his <a href=#>tattoo inspired by</a> Manny, but to end his association with the now-politician for good. Here’s what we know about the emotional situation.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Dave Bautista’s Manny Pacquiao tattoo is a part of his past and so is his former friend.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>As the <a href=#>Guardians of the Galaxy</a> alum shared in a now-viral <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok</a> for GQ, he changed up the ink on his arm for a very personal reason. Although Dave doesn’t mention Manny’s name specifically, he notes in the clip in part, "I was part of a team of a person I considered a friend and someone I really looked up to. And then, he later came out publicly with some anti-gay statements."</p><p>“So, I had a huge issue with it,” Dave continued, adding, “It's a personal issue with me. My mom's a lesbian. And I just could no longer call him a friend. So, I had it covered up with this.” The actor then reveals a sugar skull tattoo.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So what did Manny say that so deeply hurt Dave and so many other people?</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@gq href=#>@gq</a><p>Dave Bautista on why he got one of his coverup tattoos <a title=gq href=#>#GQ</a> <a title=tattootour href=#>#TattooTour</a> <a title=wwe href=#>#WWE</a> <a title=davebautista href=#>#DaveBautista</a> <a title=mcu href=#>#MCU</a> <a title=tattoos href=#>#Tattoos</a> <a title=bautista href=#>#Bautista</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - GQ - GQ" href=#>♬ original sound - GQ - GQ</a></figure><p>Fans can easily infer that Dave is talking about his relationship with Manny, whose <a href=#>anti-gay comments</a> made international headlines in 2016. As <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN</a> reports, while running for a senate seat in his native Philippines, Manny was interviewed for a TV show, and said about gay people, “It’s common sense. Will you see any animals where male is to male and female is to female?”</p><p>“The animals are better,” he cringingly continued. “They know how to distinguish male from female. If we approve [of] male on male, female on female, then man is worse than animals.”</p><p>Although Manny later offered a public mea culpa via social media, he didn’t exactly walk back his comments, and said hurting people was wrong, but added, “this does not change my position against <a href=#>same sex marriage</a>. That’s what I believe. My only mistake is comparing gay people to animals.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Dave, a huge tattoo lover, is not the only celebrity who has spoken out against Manny.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>"Through my tattoos, I tell the story of my life."

Hilariously, the ink was based on a photo of <a href=#>Peaky Blinders’ Cillian Murphy</a>, a fact that eagle-eyed fans quickly picked up on as soon as the tattoo was revealed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfma63sYybmK6smajBonnMmqWnsV2lrqS91KKYqGWklsG1u84%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./gina-rodriguez-birth-first-child-joe-locicero.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Gina Rodriguez Has Reportedly Given Birth, Welcomes First Child with Joe LoCicero</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./royal-family-holiday-gift-guide-148538.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>7 Gifts You Can Buy So That Your Christmas Is Just Like the Royal Familys</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amal-clooney-mob-wife-trend-cream-fur-coat.html>Amal Clooney Elevates the Mob Wife Trend in a Cream Fur Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./demolition-underway-at-washington-elementary-davenport.html>Demolition underway at Washington Elementary, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iowa-man-killed-in-head-on-crash.html>Iowa man killed in head-on crash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./style-edit-richard-milles-technically-ambitious-new-rm-30-01-automatic-luxury-watch-was-inspired.html>Style Edit: Richard Milles technically ambitious new RM 30-01 Automatic luxury watch was inspired</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./463481-what-happened-frankie-lons-life-story-death.html>What happened to Frankie Lons?
