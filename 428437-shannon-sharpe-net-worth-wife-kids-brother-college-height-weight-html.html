He was born to parents, Pete Sharpe and Mary Alice Dixon. His childhood was pretty difficult, with his parents divorcing when he was only a few month's old. As a result, his mother and siblings moved to Glenville, Georgia and were raised on a farm.</p><p class=align-left>Shannon has two older siblings – a brother, Sterling Sharpe and a sister, Sherra Sharpe. Shannon Sharpe’s brother was also a former professional American football player. He played in the NFL as a wide receiver and was considered one of the top talents in the game before a neck injury ended his career.</p><p class=align-left>Growing up, Shannon’s family was very poor, and he had to work in tobacco fields and farms to earn money. On top of that, he had to balance work with his <a href=#>education</a> at Glenville High School, where he pursued his high <a href=#>school</a> education. Luckily, he was able to graduate and earn admission to Savannah State University.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5c2018bf144584df.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=32><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Bryton James: Net worth, wife, nationality, salary, parents, family</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/71763a77e2fb6a3f.png><p class=align-left>At Savannah State, Shannon pursued a course in criminal justice. He has revealed that he wasn’t a top student, but he managed to graduate with a Bachelor of <a href=#>Science</a> degree in Criminal Justice in 1989.</p><p class=align-left>Shannon, however, was a star athlete. He played basketball and football for the Savannah State University teams. He also competed in track and field events (discus, triple jump, and long jump).</p><p class=align-left>Shannon Sharpe's college football career was quite impressive, leading the football team to their best performance in his junior and senior years. He also posted an amazing 61 passes, 18 touchdowns, and 1,312 yards in his senior year. Overall, he posted 192 interceptions and 40 touchdowns for the Savannah State Tigers in his <a href=#>college</a> career.</p><h2>NFL career</h2><p class=align-left>While Shannon was a great college football player, NFL teams did not consider him a promising talent. The reason was due to his size, which made it harder to place him in the best positions he played.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5c71db2378250057.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=32><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Ryan Hurst: height, wife, family, net worth, religion, characters</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Nonetheless, Shannon was picked by Denver Broncos in the 7th round and as the 192nd pick. He had a poor two first seasons, catching only 29 passes while playing as a receiver. However, this changed in the third season, when he was switched to a tight end. In that season alone, he caught 53 passes.</p><p class=align-left>Shannon Sharpe won two championship rings with the Broncos during the 1998 and 1999 Super Bowl Championships. He then moved to Baltimore Ravens as a free agent, where he spent two seasons. While at the club, he added another championship ring to his collection during the 2001 Super Bowl Championship. He then returned to Broncos, where he continued playing until his retirement in 2003.</p><h2>Sports analyst</h2><p class=align-left>After retiring from NFL, Shannon joined CBS Sports, where he became a commentator for the show <i>NFL Today. </i>In 2013, he was hired by <i>Fitness RX for Men </i>as a columnist and a spokesperson. Unfortunately, the CBS gig for the <i>NFL Today</i> show ended in 2015. Currently, he hosts the <i>Opening Drive</i> morning show on Sirius NFL Radio and sports show, <i>Skip </i>and <i>Shannon: Undisputed on Fox Sports 1.</i></p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d186d56a64966b60.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Avery James Steines: 5 quick facts about Mark Steines' son</span></p></a><h2>Wife and children</h2><p class=align-left>Who is Shannon Sharpe’s wife? Being a public figure, the former NFL player’s love life has generated a lot of interest. However, he has never been married to this day and is assumed to be <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">currently single.</a></p><p class=align-left>However, Shannon has been involved in several <a href=#>relationships</a>, though he has kept a tight lid on his personal life. The most prominent relationship was with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">ex-girlfriend Katy Kellner</a>, a fitness instructor. The couple were rumoured to be engaged and were together for five years, but the relationship ended suddenly with neither party offering a reason.</p><p class=align-left>Shannon was also involved in a highly publicized and controversial affair with another woman, Michelle Bundy. Sometime around 2010, the woman claimed to be the NFL's player girlfriend and accused him of, among other things, sexual assault. This resulted in a criminal investigation, later dismissed after the courts found that she had fabricated her story.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/983b40415f243d8a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jeremy Rytky: What you should know about Andrea Barber's ex-husband</span></p></a><p class=align-left>While the former NFL <a href=#>player </a>is not married, he has two daughters, Kaley and Kayla Sharpe, and a son, Kiari Sharpe.
