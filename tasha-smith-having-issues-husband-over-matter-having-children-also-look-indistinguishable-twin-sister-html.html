Her husband was also her manager. However, Tasha and her husband were not happy with each other. Both of them were dissatisfied with their marriage. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Keith suspected Tasha of having an extramarital affair because she had to get closer to other actors in her profession. In return, Tasha filed for divorce, claiming that her husband had concealed crucial information from her. For example, according to Tasha, her husband never told her about his five marriages before marrying her. Tasha also revealed that her husband had not paid tax for almost a decade.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Divorce Settlement Dispute:-</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Actor Dean McDermott Reaches Out of Court Agreement for Unpaid Spousal Support with Ex-Wife Mary Jo Eustace!</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>The divorce process was a disaster.

Keith, on the other hand, had to return her Mercedes Benz.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>However, the divorce was much easier as the couple did not have any kids together.

For one, they claimed that she was harassed when she couldn’t get pregnant. Other things include how Keith had swapped her diamond jewelry with cubic zirconia (a gemstone that looks similar to a diamond but is much cheaper) and how he was a serial philanderer. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, Tasha moved on with her life and found the love of her life.&nbsp;</p><h2>Who Was Tasha Smith Dating?</h2><p>Tasha was dating actor Michel K.
