Following a brief hospitalization where she was treated for her injuries, doctors have ordered additional recovery time at home for Amy, where she is now resting comfortably," reads a statement posted to her Instagram on Friday.</p><p>"Due to the doctor's orders she has had to postpone her upcoming August concerts (Knoxville, Chattanooga, Johnson City, Wilmington). The concerts have been rescheduled for April and June, 2023," the statement added.</p><p>"All tickets will be honored at the new performance dates. There are no other changes to her touring schedule at this time.

A representative told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PEOPE</a> that Grant was treated for cuts and abrasions, noting she was wearing a helmet at the time of the accident.</p><p>The singer is in stable condition, staying overnight as a precaution on Wednesday and again tonight for observation and treatment.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>The incident comes two years after Grant underwent open-heart surgery to fix a birth defect she didn't know about until a routine checkup in 2020. At the time, Grant revealed she needed surgery to fix a heart condition called PAPVR, a birth defect where one or more of the pulmonary veins do not connect correctly to the left atrium.</p><p>She showed off her surgical scar on social media following the operation (above), as she opened up about the support she's felt since she first revealed her condition.</p><p>"As people heard about the surgery I started getting messages: 'I'm praying for you' …'I'm praying for you.' People I worked with decades ago, people who have come to my concerts or listen to my music, my work family, people on social media, and my own friends and family all offered their prayers," she wrote. "And now, ten days later, I just want to say, from the moment I went to the hospital, if it really were a marathon race, I felt like I got into that runners block and as soon as it was time for the race to start there was this massive West Texas wind at my back... just pushing me through."</p><p>"Even stuff I was really scared about felt like nothing more than just a deep breath and something supernatural pushed me through it," she continued, saying her recovery felt "miraculous."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:9c09a3bc-da1d-487d-a541-e0da3ca8f295 data-container-ref=toofab:article:2710da43-af53-4ed8-91d8-7d9f0f7a71e1 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/31/5by4/2022/07/22/31736567238d4e7082dd9e850948f736_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">11 of the Longest Lasting Celebrity Friendships in Hollywood</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3N7j3Bma3Bflrq6ecarmKesXZ28tLzIrZilZZKeuKZ5wJygnZ2eqXw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./balenciaga-desfile-paris-ropa-excentrica-rara-tendencias-moda-street-style.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Balenciaga moda rara</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./alexandra-krosney.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Alexandra Krosney Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amal-clooney-mob-wife-trend-cream-fur-coat.html>Amal Clooney Elevates the Mob Wife Trend in a Cream Fur Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./demolition-underway-at-washington-elementary-davenport.html>Demolition underway at Washington Elementary, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iowa-man-killed-in-head-on-crash.html>Iowa man killed in head-on crash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./style-edit-richard-milles-technically-ambitious-new-rm-30-01-automatic-luxury-watch-was-inspired.html>Style Edit: Richard Milles technically ambitious new RM 30-01 Automatic luxury watch was inspired</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./463481-what-happened-frankie-lons-life-story-death.html>What happened to Frankie Lons?
