Speaking about why she’d make a good traitor, she told the BBC: "I look quite young and kind of innocent looking, I give off a very naïve vibe, I think. Growing up a lot of people saw this and they underestimated me. I felt like all my life I've been trying to deter&nbsp;the misjudgment&nbsp;and be the loudest, boldest, and smartest in the room."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/66469562b3a1-alyssa-traitors-z.jpg><h3>Amanda&nbsp;</h3><p id=eiWJj-nIKqrc data-wc=3><strong>Status: Traitor, eliminated&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eVkAxCvvZS6Q data-wc=51>Welsh Estate Agent Amanda has taken on the role of a traitor with aplomb and certainly sounds like she’s in it to win it.

"Everybody’s here to play a game and I have no qualms with getting rid of people. I will not feel bad about it," he said. "[…] Even if I get rid of someone who I've built a good relationship with, I don't care, that's the game. So, for me, I'm not scared to turn people against each other, if I have to."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/cff951abd60d-wilf-traitors-pic-z.jpg><h3>Hannah</h3><p id=eM7Urqtu0fZs data-wc=2><strong>Status: Faithful&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=e-LP3LDVdQQP data-wc=85>Comedian Hannah is one of the more confident members of the faithful and seems to have convinced everyone that she is in the group she says she is. But will this be enough for her to avoid suspicions? Speaking about making a good 'faithful', she said: "I’m really good at reading people, I've got really good gut instincts. I never go with my gut in real life because you have to give people the benefit of the doubt, but I'm usually always right about things."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8772d0430fea-hannah-traitors-z.jpg><h3>John</h3><p id=eXSuh1hvgVkK data-wc=3><strong>Status: Faithful, murdered</strong></p><p id=eJbFWWHQvAht data-wc=73>Spa Therapist John most certainly isn’t relaxed in the first three episodes of the show, particularly when accusing Aaron of being a traitor. Before the show, he said: "If you’re a Traitor, and you tell everyone you’re Faithful and you're not showing any emotion whatsoever when people walk in at breakfast because you know you're the one who’s got rid of someone, then it’s going to show." If only it were that easy!&nbsp;</p><p id=eoaqcffxwLCN data-wc=1><strong>MORE:<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;The Traitors: fans in an uproar over episode 10’s major plot twist</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/22e3a11ac837-john-traitors-z.jpg><h3>Maddy&nbsp;</h3><p id=eMmVnCtiI8Vl data-wc=2><strong>Status: Faithful&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eenlqBVxv5S6 data-wc=52>Maddy is an actress but initially decided to keep that information secret from her fellow contestants. Instead, she said (truthfully) that she is also a receptionist. But in episode eight, Maddy decided to reveal all which resulted in her fellow Faithfuls to suspect her and be wary of the lie she told.&nbsp;</p><p id=e9HYJcfBXqpq data-wc=35>Chatting about what she’ll bring to the game, she said: "Hopefully, a bit of humour! I don't know, to be honest... I'm a bit nervous.

The 'faithful' did her research by watching the Dutch version of the show, saying: "I've seen the first episode of the Dutch version of the show, and I can see how brutal it is. I'm&nbsp;definitely going&nbsp;to take a very friendly approach, because that's who I&nbsp;am&nbsp;and&nbsp;I wouldn't feel comfortable doing anything other than that."&nbsp;</p><p id=eyIydWO5aSCR data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>The Traitors: why Alex didn’t pick up on Amanda’s handwriting - exclusive</a></strong></p><p id=el1OdK23bTSJ data-wc=26>However, after being approached by the Traitors asking to be recruited to their team, Alex "politely declined". But her refusal resulted in her being murdered.

Or so he says… He said: "I think I'll bring a unique form of thinking. I think of everything quite literally, I don't let my emotions get the better of me. I would much rather not make it to the final than make it to the final and the Traitors still be there."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f79cb57097c6-tom-traitors-z.jpg><h3>Matt</h3><p id=eaDpaFd9pvji data-wc=3><strong>Status: Faithful, murdered</strong></p><p id=eCVNCvtWvE1j data-wc=78>BMX athlete Matt might be barking up the wrong tree with his crush on taken Alex, but that doesn’t mean he won’t have an eye out for spotting a traitor! Speaking about his trustworthy nature, he said: "I am quite gullible. I’ll believe anything unless people give me a reason not to. That’s what worries me a bit about this whole thing. If someone told me it's raining outside and it's&nbsp;actually 20&nbsp;degrees, I’d pack a jacket."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1cc24b33b916-matt-traitor-z.jpg><h3>Meryl&nbsp;</h3><p id=erVYtQQlCPjB data-wc=2><strong>Status: Faithful&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eXYEcrjR6qt0 data-wc=93>Scottish Call Centre Agent is part of the faithful team - but will she remain that way for long? Speaking about her skills at spotting a liar, she said: "I have lied, so I know a good liar when I see one as I've done that before. I’ll know who’s lying because I've said the exact same things and I'll be able to spot the exact same traits. I need to remember not to land myself in it when I'm trying to catch other people out. I need to focus on my concentration."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/72e158b47075-meryl-z.jpg><h3>Rayan&nbsp;</h3><p id=etis7PaBFsXW data-wc=3><strong>Status: Faithful, eliminated</strong></p><p id=ep61RouLD2UW data-wc=86>Trainee lawyer Rayan has kept his head down in the competition so far, and despite being a faithful we can’t help but think he’d make a brilliant traitor! Speaking about his skills going into the game, he said: "I’d be pretty incredible at lying. You need to really have the brain power for it. You need to be able to be consistent and never let your guard down. I think I've got what it takes, I’m ready to lie." Someone recruit him as a traitor ASAP!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/cc34e789cf41-rayan-traitors-z.jpg><h3>Ivan&nbsp;</h3><p id=eSNvfgclFFP6 data-wc=3><strong>Status: Faithful, eliminated</strong></p><p id=eDnZKyTpAPOm data-wc=63>Cornwall-based author Ivan is determined to get through the game with a nine-point plan - although he had admitted that it might not work out the way he hoped. He said: "I have a strong nine-point plan. I have zero confidence that it's going to work because at base, this game is chaos. You cannot control it and there is no winning strategy."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/caad1f49f0c6-ivan-traitors-z.jpg><h3>Aaron&nbsp;</h3><p id=ey7bn-NWZfV9 data-wc=2><strong>Status: Faithful&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eQQbCBkV9A8q data-wc=74>Sweet Aaron is not a traitor and definitely didn’t love it when people thought otherwise. The Property Agent spoke about how his job might help him find the traitors, saying: "I've got a background in sales, so I'll be able to read people quite well. Body language, personality, that aspect. I’m also quite a happy chappy so I reckon I won't be too intense. I’ll bring quite a lot of energy to the game."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7814ed52b716-aaron-traitors-z.jpg><h3>Andrea</h3><p id=erPegIZ29Kp- data-wc=2><strong>Status: Faithful&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=emViqs5tnCnh data-wc=103>Retiree Andrea is certain that her age and experience will put her in good stead in the game. She said: "I'm a happy person, so I hope to bring that as well, mixed in with the suspicion. I want to give the game a sense of enjoyment, although this may not be what the game is about at all… I'd like to win very much, and I don't mind banishing people at all. Although if I don't win, it’s not the end of the world.

However, so far she has hung on in there. Speaking about her game plan, she said: "I thought I would because I always thought I would be a Faithful. But now, I don't want to be a Faithful. I would love to be a Traitor, I think you have to have more of a game plan if you are one."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a7bea606ac3a-fay-traitors-z.jpg><h3>Theo&nbsp;</h3><p id=eETyYkfOcAn7 data-wc=3><strong>Status: Faithful, eliminated</strong></p><p id=ejftE-N4JO5i data-wc=77>Leeds-based Cheerleading Coach Leon’s game plan is to be a friend to all. He said: "My game plan is to be myself and let people fall in love with me. To get people to do their best and to help them believe in themselves. I always like to be that strong character and tell people they can&nbsp;do it and make them believe.
