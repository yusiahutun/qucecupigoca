Lorena Awou buckets.</p><p>When did you know basketball was your sport? “Sophomore year. Freshman year I played it but never thought it would something I would do in the future,” Awou said. “My mom played a little bit back in Africa. That impacted me to play a little more. Coming out here my sophomore year I just really knew I could play.”</p><p>In two years, Lorena Awou became the best player in the Western Big Six, United Township’s all-time rebounder and a top 150 recruit.</p><p>“You really saw it between that junior year summer that the wheels were clicking a bit,” head coach Chase Pavelonis said. “Throughout the season you’re like “Oh, this is what I want to do” from her. It was just unbelievable for her.”</p><p>“Coaches reaching out and saying I could potential play for them,” Awou said. “That made me think I could play and was capable of being D-1.</p><p>When North Carolina State came calling, Awou knew that was the place.</p><p>“The coaches and my future teammates energy was great and I liked how they played. Fast paced.”</p><p>With the spotlight on Awou, it’s always the same approach. The one she learned from her parents who came to East Moline from Togo.</p><p>“I try not to think about it and stay humble. It’s cool that people know me because of my basketball but I just try to keep my composure and play the game.”</p><p>To keep the success going, it’s about carrying Awou’s energy to her teammates.</p><p>“Her getting excited just let’s us know “Hey we got your back. We got this. Were going to take this game and win,” guard Kaylie Pena said. “It gives us a leader out there to show us the right expectations on the court.”</p><p>“A good shot. A good lay-up. A good anything basically. Just any of those brings up my energy and makes me know were doing that,” Awou said.</p><p>Awou and the Panthers look for win number 16 Thursday against Geneseo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfqL2wvtOsZpqvn6p6rq3KoqWgZZmivaKv02aip6eno3qnu9FmrGasXZy2s7jSZpmaq5uawaOty6Vm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./659be98046163feab38b45aa-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Open de Australia 2024: Cunto dinero se reparte en premios en el Open de Australia 2024: ganador,</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./523202-who-lana-rhoades-dating-s-what-far.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Lana Rhoades dating now?
