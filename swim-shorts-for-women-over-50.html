So we (regular women with stretch marks, mom tums, and <a href=#>cellulite</a>) decided to do some serious swimwear research to find the <a rel=noopener href=#>perfect swimsuit</a> for all women. In that quest, we’ve found <a href=#>slimming swimsuits</a>, <a href=#>plus size bikinis</a>, and even <a href=#>flowy coverups</a> that can double as dresses.</p><p>But if conservative swimwear is more your style, <a rel=noopener href=#>swim shorts for women</a> (not the baggy trunks guys wear), tick all the right boxes: full-seat coverage, protection from chaffing, and overall comfort.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Swimsuits For All</a></strong>, an inclusive online swimwear shop, has a great selection of swim shorts in a variety of styles that pair well with one-piece swimsuits, tankini tops, and more. Best of all, they have pretty much every numbered size you can imagine, because, let’s be honest, small/medium/large can be a tough squeeze for some booties. <strong>Scroll down for our favorite swim shorts for women from <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Swimsuits for All</a>.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Best Deals On Swim Shorts:</h2><ul><li><strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">50% off at Swimsuits For All></a></strong></li></ul><h2 class=block-product__title><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Venus Swim Short</a></h2><span class=block-product__eyebrow>Best overall swim short for women</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/05/Untitled-design-2023-04-12T124037.608.jpg><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy from Venus, $27.99</a></strong></p><h3 class=block-product-list__title>Features:</h3><ul><li>Bottoms can be folded up on down</li><li>Some designs made of recycled material</li><li>Comes in 7 different colors</li></ul><p>Have a pool party scheduled but not in the mood to wax?
