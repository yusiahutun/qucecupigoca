He has a minimal presence on popular social media platforms like Twitter and Instagram.</p><h2>Adrian’s career</h2><p class=align-left>Adrian Higham has been in the dealer industry for close to three decades. How did it all start? His story is quite interesting, and it begins with a simple buy-and-sell deal that saw him make an impressive margin that motivated him to keep doing it.</p><p class=align-left>When he was young, Adrian bought a mountain bike in a local village auction for £10 and sold it at £90. Of course, the profit of eight times the buying price was impressive.
