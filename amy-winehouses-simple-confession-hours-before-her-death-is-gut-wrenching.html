We take a look back at the gut-wrenching confession made by the <a href=#>music</a> icon, just hours before her tragic death in 2011.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/GettyImages-79697034-677x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-amy-winehouse-s-gut-wrenching-confession-hours-before-tragic-death>Amy Winehouse’s gut-wrenching confession hours before tragic death</h2><p>Amy Winehouse tragically passed away on July 23, 2011, after being found “lifeless” in her bed in her North London home. It was later said she suffered from “accidental alcohol poisoning” during an inquest into her death at St Pancras Coroner’s Court in London.</p><p>She has suffered from alcohol and drug problems for years, however, the star did not drink for the first three weeks of July before her death.</p><p>Days before, she started to drink again, as her GP Dr Christina Romete told the court the Grammy Award winner had a pattern where she would abstain from the booze for weeks, only to start again after.</p><p>The night before her tragic death, her doctor, who made a visit to her home said, Amy had accepted the seriousness of her condition and chillingly told her: “I don’t want to die”.</p><p>Speaking on Amy’s demeanor on the night before she died, Dr Romete said the singer appeared “calm and somewhat guilty” and was “tipsy” but “able to hold a conversation”.</p><p>“She was one of the most intelligent young women I’ve ever met. She was very determined to do everything her way, including her therapy. She had very strict views on that,” she revealed.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-amy-winehouse-s-ex-says-he-d-do-everything-differently>Amy Winehouse’s ex says he’d do “everything differently”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/GettyImages-78108485-1024x738.jpg><p>To mark her 40th birthday, the Valerie singer’s ex-boyfriend Blake Fielder-Civil, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">appeared</a> on Good Morning Britain to reflect on her milestone birthday. Due to Amy’s <a href=#>celebrity</a> status, the relationship and divorce were made pretty public.</p><p>Blake was married to Amy for two years, between 2007 and 2009. When asked what he would have done if he could turn back time, the 41-year-old responded: “Almost everything differently.”</p><p>“It’s devastating she’s not here. I think about her all the time, I thought about her this morning when I said my happy birthday to her, she was my best friend.</p><p>“If it wasn’t for certain factors I think it could have been a different outcome. Everything happened very quickly for Amy. We were young,” he continued.</p><p>Amy’s ex-husband has been blamed by many for her Class-A drug addiction which started after they met, as he later admitted to giving the star her first ‘shot’ of heroin.</p><p>In his GMB interview, he opened up about being blamed for her tragic death, and said he needed to “stop carrying that burden”.</p><p>“I do [get blamed] and that’s ok. I can’t change what other people feel about that, but for me personally, I needed to stop carrying that burden. I’ve carried it for over 10 years,” he expressed.</p><p>He then went on to say he was the “only person within that story that’s ever held any accountability”.</p><p>I tried to say I made some huge mistakes. I was a 20-something-old drug addict.</p><p>“I had no idea how to make myself clean, let alone someone else. There were vested interests in Amy carrying on performing too. The fragility is what people connected within the albums,” he said.</p><p>When asked if he’d spoken to or, re-established a relationship with Winehouses’ family, Blake revealed: “I haven’t, to be honest. I’ve kind of ascertained from my own kind of thinking.”</p><p><strong>If you’ve been affected by this story you can contact American Addiction Centers on (877) 686-7688 or Talk To Frank on 0300 123 6600 in the UK.</strong></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlxX2aBcK3MsmSwoZ6atbDB0p6qZquZor2tsYycpqeelajAqrvNZp%2BoraKoeqOxxaipnmWYmr9usMSaq6Flmah6qMHTZq6rnZ6Ytaq6xmg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./evan-peters-admits-playing-serial-killer-jeffrey-dahmer-one-hardest-things-hes-done-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Evan Peters admits playing serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer was one of 'hardest' things he's ever done</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rhoslc-fans-react-heather-gays-new-face-ozempic-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>RHOSLC fans react to Heather Gay's 'new face' after WWHL appearance... two months after admitting to</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amal-clooney-mob-wife-trend-cream-fur-coat.html>Amal Clooney Elevates the Mob Wife Trend in a Cream Fur Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./demolition-underway-at-washington-elementary-davenport.html>Demolition underway at Washington Elementary, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iowa-man-killed-in-head-on-crash.html>Iowa man killed in head-on crash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./style-edit-richard-milles-technically-ambitious-new-rm-30-01-automatic-luxury-watch-was-inspired.html>Style Edit: Richard Milles technically ambitious new RM 30-01 Automatic luxury watch was inspired</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./463481-what-happened-frankie-lons-life-story-death.html>What happened to Frankie Lons?
