His Bupkis salary is reported to be around $500,000, according to <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://variety.com/2022/tv/features/tv-salaries-kevin-costner-sylveter-stallone-millions-1235320075/>Variety.</a></p><p>Pete Davidson’s SNL salary varied throughout his time as a castmember. When a cast member joins the cast in their first year as a featured player, they are paid $7,000 per episode according to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Celebrity Net Worth.</a>&nbsp;There are 21 episodes per season (excluding when COVID-19 lockdowns were in place in 2020 and during the SAG-AFTRA/Writers’ Guild Strike of 2023), so starter salaries totals to $147,000 per season. Second-year cast members make $8,000 per episode, or $168,000 per season. If a cast member makes it to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">their fifth season</a>, they make $15,000 per episode, or $315,000 per season. Since he was on for quite a while and definitely one of the most prominent cast members on the show, his salary was definitely up there.</p><p>For other sources of income, Davidson sometimes extensively tours. When Jimmy Fallon asked <a href=# data-type=link data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPcBED-82VE" rel=nofollow>who paid the bill </a>at Kid Cudi’s infamous birthday dinner, Pete admitted that he did and then when Kanye West came around, he told his touring agent to book more shows because the rapper kept ordering the expensive items.</p><p>As to some shenanigans he’s been up to with fellow Staten Island-er Colin Jost, the SNL co-stars bought a de-commissioned Staten Island Ferry for $280,000 which they plan to revamp into an entertainment boat.</p><p>“I have no idea what’s going on with that thing,” he said when he was <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.etonline.com/interview-pete-davidson-shares-update-on-staten-island-ferry-he-bought-with-colin-jost-exclusive-205876 rel=nofollow>asked about it</a> on the red carpet of Transformers: Rise Of The Beasts. “Me and Colin&nbsp;were very stoned a year ago and bought a ferry. And we’re figuring it out.”</p><p>Seth Meyers grilled him about his decision and sardonically asked if they thought the whole thing through. “We have to, ’cause we’re in the hole,” Davidson replied. “Colin called me, and he’s like, ‘Hey, can you hop on this call about the ferry?’ I was like, ‘We’re still doing that thing?’ He’s like, ‘Yeah, this is pretty serious.’ And it is! I had no idea, I just saw a link and sent a deposit, and now I’m stuck with a f–kin’ boat.”</p><p>Pete also dabbles in some bar ownership is a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>part owner of the New York City bar Pebble Bar</a> which is close to SNL‘s home at Rockefeller Center.
