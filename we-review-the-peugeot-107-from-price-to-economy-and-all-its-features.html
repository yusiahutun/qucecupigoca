Peugeot 107 has great residual value</p><p>Which is why the Peugeot 107 makes a lot of sense, because it has the much-sought-after title of being the best new car for beating depreciation.</p><p>Used car experts at Glass’s Guide estimate the 107 holds on to 60.9 per cent of its original list price after three years, when you add in running costs such as fuel and tax.</p><p>And that seemed a good enough reason to test the little Peugeot and find out just what you get for your money.</p><p>The 107 has always been a cute small car, with those bug-eyed headlights and big Peugeot grille, and it was given a minor face-lift at the start of this year to keep it fresh.</p><p>My week-long test was also a good reminder of how far dinky city cars have progressed from the cheap and basic models of just a few years ago.</p><p>On the inside it has more space than its compact size would suggest — you can fit in four tall grown-ups at a squeeze.</p><p>It’s also well laid-out, with a modern dashboard that is all the better for a minimal number of buttons. You have just what you need on view, such as heater and music controls.</p><p>And I like the way Peugeot have brightened up the cabin by using a colour co-ordinated bare metal finish on the doors together with fluorescent and coloured plastic trim on the heater controls.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">more motors</h2></p><p>You may not expect a lot from the 1litre three-cylinder engine but even that has a bit of zip which gives the 107 its own character.</p><p>It struggles if you hit a big hill but around town it’s actually fun nipping in and out of traffic thanks to its slick gearbox, and it is perfectly happy cruising at just above the motorway speed limit.</p><p>It’s also ideal for tight city parking spaces.</p><p>Throw in fuel economy at just over 60mpg, CO2 emissions of 106g/km which cost you just £35 a year for road tax, and the 107 stacks up well whichever way you look at it.</p><p>In many ways the 107 underlines why lots of motorists who spend most of their time commuting in the city don’t actually need a big car any more.</p><p>And when you throw in the depreciation factor, the 107 makes even more sense, especially with prices starting at £8,095 — which is reduced by a further £1,000 to £7,095 on special offer this month.</p><p>If you are eligible for the scrappage scheme it is two grand off and down to £6,095, which makes the 107 a very persuasive argument for anyone in the market for a small new car.<br></p><h2><strong>What to look out for when buying a used Peugeot 107<br></strong></h2><p>The 107 is a car designed to be cheap and cheerful - so build quality isn’t really its forté.&nbsp;However, the car’s simplicity helps with reliability as there’s not much to go wrong.</p><p>You still need to check for water in the boot, though, as the door, light and aerial seals can all fail. So, too, can the rear wheel brake cylinders and exhaust back boxes. Clutches can also fail prematurely because of water getting into the bell housing.</p><p>While this might sound like a lot of issues, problems remain rare and fixing things is usually cheap.</p><p>Since it arrived, the Peugeot 107 has seen a number of recalls: &nbsp;wheel studs working loose, the accelerator failing to return properly, the suspension failing, the engine self-destructing, and most recently, for the failure of a rear suspension cross-member.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqamraeiqHxzgpFxa2ltX6yybr7Er6Cer12ptaZ5z56soJ2fqXpyfJZmnaunnWK9s7XCnmStp12asLC6zqawZpmemXqiuMtmoK2rXZuyosDUq5ysZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./15-astounding-facts-about-mysore-zoo.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>15 Astounding Facts About Mysore Zoo</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./retired-farmer-dead-slurry-pit-took-life-hours-changing-will-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Retired farmer found dead in slurry pit took his own life hours after changing his will</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amal-clooney-mob-wife-trend-cream-fur-coat.html>Amal Clooney Elevates the Mob Wife Trend in a Cream Fur Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./demolition-underway-at-washington-elementary-davenport.html>Demolition underway at Washington Elementary, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iowa-man-killed-in-head-on-crash.html>Iowa man killed in head-on crash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./style-edit-richard-milles-technically-ambitious-new-rm-30-01-automatic-luxury-watch-was-inspired.html>Style Edit: Richard Milles technically ambitious new RM 30-01 Automatic luxury watch was inspired</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./463481-what-happened-frankie-lons-life-story-death.html>What happened to Frankie Lons?
