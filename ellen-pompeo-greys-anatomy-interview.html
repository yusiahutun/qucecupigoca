"I feel protected to do that — I wasn't always."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She explains to Brown that confidence was something that came with age. "I think there's something that just hits you when you turn 50 where you literally don't give a fuck," she says. "At 50, you don't do anything you don't want to do."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The actress jokes about that same old catch-22 — that we learn to appreciate what we had once it's starting to fade.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"You spend your whole twenties criticizing yourself, comparing yourself to other women, thinking you're not good enough," she says. "And then in your thirties, you're sort of still doing that a little bit and figuring it out. The forties, I think you really start to feel yourself, and right when you start feeling yourself in your forties: fifties. You're like, 'Oh my goodness. Don't leave me. Youth, skin, come back!'" she jokes before adding, "Life is really quite cruel, actually. When you think about it, youth is wasted on the young."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-ellen-pompeo-doesnt-do-anything-she-doesnt-want-to-episode-35-july-27-2021></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Ellen Pompeo Doesn't Do Anything She Doesn't Want To: Episode 35: July 27, 2021</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Duration: </strong>46 minutes</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This podcast may contain cursing that would not be appropriate for listeners under 14. Discretion is advised.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sure, some of that confidence probably comes from the insight and experience Pompeo gained being on one of the most popular television dramas, Grey's Anatomy, for the past 17 years.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I can see people now in a work environment and really see how they're performing," she says. "I know how sets run, and I know when someone is burnt out. I know when someone is afraid to speak up, and I know when someone is bored and not contributing. I know when a director's phoning it in. I can see people's behavior pretty clearly."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So best not to try faking it around<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2> Pompeo</a>, because she'll be able to tell. She keeps it extremely real, herself. In a revelatory <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>Hollywood Reporter story</a>, the actress opened up about how she got to be network television's highest-paid woman. She tells Brown, "You can think you're worth something, but you also have to be able to back that up with real, hard numbers and show that you're able to generate money," she says. "No one really gives a fuck what you think you're worth. These people in business affairs run these numbers and decide what people will be paid. You have to speak a different language." In the podcast above, she translates that language and explains exactly the kind of talk that landed her the raise.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sure, things on the set of Grey's haven't always been perfect. It took her 10-plus years to finally get what she deserved in the work place. And she tells Brown that while she and her cast mates had something very special, there was also a lot of competition, which led to occasional fights on set.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But all in all, she reminisces about the early days on set and her old cast mates like Sandra Oh, Katherine Heigl, and of course, her McDreamy TV-husband played by Patrick Dempsey.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"During the early days we all really had something," she said "We had a lot of fun back then."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The early cast's palpable chemistry has always made the show that much more believable, and created a real emotional reaction from the audience. She and and former co-star Dempsey (who returned for an epic beach wedding dream sequence on the most recent season) had so much chemistry that her husband Chris Ivery used to get jealous during those kissing scenes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Poor guy had no idea what he was getting into," she says. "I remember in the beginning it was really hard for him. He was like, 'This is not what I signed up for. You go to work and make out with that. I like Patrick and everything, he's a good dude, but like really?'"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Listen to the full episode and subscribe on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Apple</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayerFM</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Spotify</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel="noreferrer noopener">Stitcher</a>, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.
