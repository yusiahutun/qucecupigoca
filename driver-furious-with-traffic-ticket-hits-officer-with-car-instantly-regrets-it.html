F--- off and get in your car," he shouts at the officer, ignoring his knocks on the window.</p><p>Winding it down a crack, he snatches the ticket out of the officer's hands. "You're a f---ing little bitch, gimme my ticket and go f--- yourself. Goofball f---ing f----t," he yells, dropping a homophobic slur. "F--- you!"</p><p>"F--- off you bitch! You're a f---ing clown!" he yells back as he suddenly speeds away — and apparently makes the fatal error of bumping into the officer while doing so.</p><p>Instantly, the blue lights are flashing behind him once again, and this time the officer is not going to be so patient with him.</p><p>"You like pushed him, 'you just hit me!' the wife mocks the officer from the passenger seat, an on camera admission that will likely be used against them in court. "Again, here we f--king go. F--- are you serious?" she moans to the camera. "Third f---ing time in five f---ing minutes."</p><p>But the tone quickly changes in the car when the officer arrives with taser drawn, and smashes their window in.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:b24da196-38ca-4452-b671-250ff72209e2 data-container-ref=toofab:article:6c0be9c5-5372-4c3e-95b1-4415234dd617 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/93/5by4/2021/05/19/931257060a3d478d8a746d8b462992a2_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Twitter/Richmond County Sheriff's Office</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Mother Savagely Beaten in Little Caesars While Infant Daughter Tries to Intervene</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"He's got his gun on me now! The RCMP officer has his gun on me now," he hurriedly tells the police dispatcher he just called. "Holy f--- get a member here! Help me! He's tripping balls! Holy f--- help me!"</p><p>His wife begs the dispatcher "Send more people please! There's another officer but he just told me to shut up."</p><p>Her husband is dragged away in cuffs, still shouting until he is out of earshot.</p><p>A second officer then searches the car and confiscates a can of bear mace, while the wife demands an explanation.</p><p>"You can't drive your vehicle into a police officer," the first cop patiently explains, apparently wiping blood from a cut he sustained smashing the window. "I was standing right here and he sideswiped me. It's the same as any other motor vehicle collision, except that it was with a person and he did it intentionally."</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CTV News</a>, the driver was charged with Assault, two counts of Stunting under the Traffic Safety Act, and Possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public, relating to the can of mace. He is due in court July 21.</p><p>Snoop Dogg was among the many sharing the vid as it did the rounds on social media, highlighting it as an example of the "2 justice systems".</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>In a homophobia-filled video posted after his release, the man claimed the officers beat him to a point he had to leave jail in an ambulance.</p><p>"Now they're circling the block, all his buddies are bullying me," he says. "So if I end up dead or in a shootout tonight with the police, I just wanted to make everybody aware that I've talked with their watch commander, I tried to file a complaint with K-Division, I've called everybody I can."</p><p>"So now I'm just sitting with some patriots that are licensed to protect themselves, and are very good hunters, and they're gonna defend me tonight."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:399f09f2-4374-47ec-ae94-fd76195f50a3 data-container-ref=toofab:article:6c0be9c5-5372-4c3e-95b1-4415234dd617 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/c8/5by4/2021/03/25/c880a6a6e6d649868b2ff07ed8d30ad2_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">NBC/GoFundMe</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">14-Year-Old Girl Sentenced to 7 Years for Murder of Uber Eats Driver in Botched Carjacking</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3J7j25ma2hfmb%2BqwsSrZJ%2Btop68tr%2BMsKCtoF2pv6KyxaKaZqyZmLimwIyhoK2rXaSzp7XCnqlmr5mptW6vwKtkoqajqa6vwMuyZKudl6eytb%2BMoqto</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./katie-holmes-embellished-denim.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Katie Holmes wears embellished two tone jeans and blazer</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./devon-sawa-celebrates-12-years-sober-officially-tells-people-worth-clean-up-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Devon Sawa celebrates '12 years sober, officially' and tells people that 'its worth it' to clean</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amal-clooney-mob-wife-trend-cream-fur-coat.html>Amal Clooney Elevates the Mob Wife Trend in a Cream Fur Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./demolition-underway-at-washington-elementary-davenport.html>Demolition underway at Washington Elementary, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iowa-man-killed-in-head-on-crash.html>Iowa man killed in head-on crash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./style-edit-richard-milles-technically-ambitious-new-rm-30-01-automatic-luxury-watch-was-inspired.html>Style Edit: Richard Milles technically ambitious new RM 30-01 Automatic luxury watch was inspired</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./463481-what-happened-frankie-lons-life-story-death.html>What happened to Frankie Lons?
