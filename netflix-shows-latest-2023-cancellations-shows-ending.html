According to the VP of content, Cindy Holland, cancellations also depend on how much the show costs to make in relation to how many views it is getting. She spoke at the Code Conference: "The basic calculation is, how much viewing are we getting for what it costs? We also look at, is it reaching different audiences. Is it gaining critical acclaim? Is it doing something for us as a business that we like?"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/06d4cad3b5a3-october-faction-z.jpg><h2>Messiah&nbsp;</h2><p id=eK-jhUKaXu2M data-wc=87>The controversial show was cancelled after one season, with star Wil Traval writing on Instagram: "It’s a very sad day today.

The first season is a complete, stand-alone story that we are proud to feature on Netflix for years to come."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/50ac9d541202-seven-seconds-z.jpg><h2>American Vandal</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7754219606b1-tv-american-vandal-z.jpg><h2>The OA</h2><p id=e5xKkR_rlcMn5 data-wc=41>The strange and unique story about a missing blind woman, who is found with her eyesight back, had viewers talking – both good and bad. Unfortunately, the show was cancelled after just two series, and ahead of completing the story arc.</p><p id=eV0mcRjSoyrwK data-wc=67>Creator Brit Marling posted about the situation on Instagram, writing: "Zal and I are deeply sad not to finish this story. It's been an intense journey for everyone who worked on and cared about this story." Rebel Wilson was among those to mourn the loss of the show, and commented on Brit's post: "Congrats on such an awesome, imaginative and creative show." Emma Roberts added: "I'm devastated."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c8ff1fad8f47-the-oa-brit-z.jpg><h2>Santa Clarita Diet</h2><p id=eiaTgVeKxHHGH data-wc=60>Despite having a passionate fan base, Drew Barrymore's zombie drama just didn't make the cut, and Netflix confirmed they were cancelling the show after its third series. The co-creators Victor Fresco and Tracy Katsky said: "Netflix took a chance on this odd show and for that we will always be grateful. They were supportive, ever-positive, and appreciative of our work.</p><p id=eyUp2IP5u89ro data-wc=51>"Until about noon today. Still, they were just one phone call away from being a perfect studio. Not bad. Everything ends. This was a thing. And so it ended." Tracy told CNN: "They called us with the news yesterday. We are all so sad. We have loved making it so much."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/013abf3763be-tv-santa-z.jpg><h2>Sense8</h2><p id=efs10tA09dSs8 data-wc=64>Fans were so outraged when Sense8 was cancelled after its second season – with Netflix's vice president Cindy Holland explaining to Radio Times that "if you don't have the viewership showing up to justify the expense of the series, you're going to want to end it" – that Netflix ended up relenting and giving the show a two-hour finale episode to wrap everything up.</p><p id=eYyLRW_jcoL2U data-wc=57>At the time, the show's co-creator Lana Wachowski posted a letter to fans: "Improbably, unforeseeably, your love has brought Sense8 back to life… It is my great pleasure as well as Netflix's… to announce that there will be another two hour special released next year. Thank you all. Now let's go find out what happens to Wolfgang."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/161dfc8fe483-tv-sense8-1-z.jpg><h2>One Day at a Time</h2><p id=eWYdDMOm-dJ3d data-wc=58>Speaking about season four, Netflix said: "We've made the very difficult decision not to renew One Day at a Time for a fourth season. The choice did not come easily — we spent several weeks trying to find a way to make another season work but in the end simply not enough people watched to justify another season."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8d6b1a5cd297-tv-family-z.jpg><h2>Travelers</h2><p id=etQlAC1t5Aaw4 data-wc=74>Eric McCormack confirmed that Travelers wouldn't be renewed for a fourth season. Posting on Twitter, he said: "A lot of you have been asking about the possibility of a Season 4, but many of you have been saying, 'Look, if this is it, what a moving and surprising and profound ending it is.' Well I'm afraid it is. Who knows what the future holds but Travelers programme one as we call it is complete."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/18c2d9ffefb4-tv-travelers-z.jpg><h2>Designated Survivor</h2><p id=eAlyq6zIhWEoe data-wc=95>The popular political drama was cancelled in July 2019 after initially being saved by Netflix for a third season. Netflix released a statement which read: "We are proud to have offered fans a third season of Designated Survivor, and will continue to carry all three seasons for years to come. We're especially thankful to star and executive producer Kiefer Sutherland, who brought passion, dedication and an unforgettable performance as President Kirkman." Kiefer seemed happy to let the show go, saying: "I think it's time for us all to go and find something new to do."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f4d446e7e236-tv-survivor-z.jpg><h2>The Good Cop</h2><p id=eXqWKP8J5lgU- data-wc=75>Sadly for Josh Groban, who played a straight-laced detective who had to deal with his rule-breaking father, The Good Cop was cancelled after just one series. In a statement to Variety, Netflix said: "The Good Cop will not return for a second season. We're grateful to creator Andy Breckman and his fellow producers, writers, the incredible crew and especially stars Tony Danza and Josh Groban for bringing this classic odd couple father-son story to Netflix."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/49c0f0db87ce-tv-good-cop-z.jpg><h2>The Punisher and Jessica Jones</h2><p id=e-4ycluKvPM4s data-wc=44>After Iron Fist, Daredevil and Luke Cage were cancelled in a cull of Marvel TV shows, it seemed hardly surprising when The Punisher and Jessica Jones followed suit, despite nearly all of the shows (Iron Fist excluded) garnering positive reviews from critics and fans.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/62c853e64760-tv-jessica-z.jpg><p id=e8x7uXpGPSEfc data-wc=80>Speaking about cancelling the two shows, Netflix said: "Marvel's The Punisher will not return for a third season on Netflix. Showrunner Steve Lightfoot, the terrific crew, and exceptional cast including star Jon Bernthal, delivered an acclaimed and compelling series for fans, and we are proud to showcase their work on Netflix for years to come. In addition, in reviewing our Marvel programming, we have decided that the upcoming third season will also be the final season for Marvel's Jessica Jones.</p><p id=eaB1xDTjd6W1x data-wc=59>"We are grateful to showrunner Melissa Rosenberg, star Krysten Ritter and the entire cast and crew, for three incredible seasons of this groundbreaking series, which was recognized by the Peabody Awards among many others.

I can't wait for you all to see it."</p><h2>Friends from College</h2><p id=eyjBHcV8cBESK data-wc=91>The director of the comedy-drama Friends from College, Nicholas Stoller, announced the news that the comedy was cancelled in a short but sweet message which read: "Friends from College will not be returning for a third season. Thanks to everyone who watched it. Happy Presidents' Day!" Fans were unsurprisingly disappointed, with one writing: "This really and truly SUCKS! This was a clever show that was able to funny and dramatic at the same time. Netflix used to give us something different but now it's letting some of us down with mediocrity."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a0e919d780e8-tv-ffc-z.jpg><h2>Tuca & Bertie</h2><p id=e820EA7XNPSBg data-wc=37>Following the popularity of shows like BoJack Horseman and Big Mouth, it seemed that this animated series about the friendship between two bird women would be a slam dunk. However, it appears season two wasn't to be.</p><p id=et8gk4kXxIYqO data-wc=74>The creator, Lisa Hanawalt, took to Twitter to express her disappointment, writing: "Everyone is still glowing over the reviews and articles and feedback. T&B is critically acclaimed and has repeatedly been called one of the best new shows of the year… Best of all, I still get daily messages and tweets from viewers who connect personally to the characters and stories. The birdsona & plantsona fan art is SO incredible, are you kidding me!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d995aed84b29-tv-tuca-z.jpg><p id=eenLMQVeSCwyx data-wc=77>"And the show is still being discovered by new fans every day! None of this makes a difference to an algorithm, but it's important to me and the way I want to continue making art in this world. Thank you to everyone who loves and supports T&B, and to everyone who was comforted and felt like this show gave you a voice. I'm hopeful we can find a home for Tuca & Bertie to continue their adventures."</p><p id=ex2SDAM2M7p7w data-wc=14><strong>Like this story?<a class=hm-link href=#> Sign up to our newsletter</a> to get other stories like this delivered straight to your inbox.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5rZ2trYGZ%2FdH2Va2tya1%2BjsrWyy6KvZquYpMS0ecuaq56rpGJ%2FcX6SZpqappOaua2t06Kmp6tdqLWww9JmnKecmaO0cA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./6184610322601dac1d8b45a5-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Champions League: Clattenburg: &amp;quot;Pit el penalti a Torres porque devolva el equilibrio, el Madrid</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-lion-king-cast-meet-the-voices-of-the-live-action-characters.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'The Lion King' Cast: Meet the Voices of the Live-Action Characters</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amal-clooney-mob-wife-trend-cream-fur-coat.html>Amal Clooney Elevates the Mob Wife Trend in a Cream Fur Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./demolition-underway-at-washington-elementary-davenport.html>Demolition underway at Washington Elementary, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iowa-man-killed-in-head-on-crash.html>Iowa man killed in head-on crash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./style-edit-richard-milles-technically-ambitious-new-rm-30-01-automatic-luxury-watch-was-inspired.html>Style Edit: Richard Milles technically ambitious new RM 30-01 Automatic luxury watch was inspired</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./463481-what-happened-frankie-lons-life-story-death.html>What happened to Frankie Lons?
