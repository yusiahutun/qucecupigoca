We ranked <a href=# rel=noopener>The Voice coaches by the most wins</a>, and if you’ve been a fan of <a href=# id=auto-tag_nbc data-tag=nbc>NBC</a>‘s singing competition for the past nine years, it should be obvious who’s on top.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>The Voice premiered</a> in April 2011 with judges Adam Levine, <a href=# id=auto-tag_blake-shelton data-tag=blake-shelton>Blake Shelton</a>, CeeLo Green and Christina Aguilera. The concept was simple: Contestants would sing and the judges, who have their backs to the stage, would press a red button that would spin their chair around if they like a contestant’s voice. And voila! That contestant is now on that singer’s team. If more than one coach spins their chair for a contestant, the contestant is now in the power position to choose who they want to be on a team with. At the end, the winner of The Voice isn’t just the contestant who won the competition. It’s also the judge who coached them to the finale.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ariana-grande-net-worth.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/the-voice-coaches-season-25.png><p>With 14 judges over the course of <a href=# rel=noopener>The Voice‘s 18 seasons</a>, there have been a lot of winners. And while we don’t remember all of their names, we do remember the coaches who were in the winner’s circle the most often. Ahead, we ranked The Voice coaches by the least to most wins.</p><h2>Nick Jonas (Season 18 – Present)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/the-voice-nick-jonas.jpg><p>Wins: 0</p><p>Season 18 is Nick’s first season.

In her two seasons, Shakira also didn’t have a contestant in the finals. The furthest she got were two singers in the episode before the finale. Not everyone is cut out to be a Voice coach.</p><h2>Miley Cyrus (Season 11, 13)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/the-voice-miley-cyrus.jpg><p>Wins: 0</p><p>Miley was a two-time Voice judge in seasons 11 and 13.

He left after season five with no wins. CeeLo was close though. He was the runner-up in season 2 with Juliet Simms. He was also close in season 3 with Nicholas David (who was eliminated in third place) and season 1 with Vicci Martinez (who was sent home in fourth place.)</p><h2>Gwen Stefani (Season 7, 9, 12, 17)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/the-voice-gwen-stefani.jpg><p>Wins: 0</p><p>As Blake Shelton’s girlfriend (they met on the show in season 7), Stefani has been in her red swivel chair for many years but has yet to take home a win.

But he did take home the crown once. The “Yeah” singer won season 6 with Joshua Kaufman, making his win rate 50-50. Not bad.</p><h2 class=p2><span class=s1>Alicia Keys (Season 11 – 12, 14)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/the-voice-alicia-keys.jpg><p class=p2><span class=s1>Wins: 1</span></p><p class=p2><span class=s1>Season 12: Chris Blue</span></p><p>Alicia was only a Voice judge for three seasons.

Still, the percentage isn’t bad for such a short-time judge.</p><h2 class=p2><span class=s1>John Legend (Season 16 – Present)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/the-voice-john-legend.jpg><p class=p2><span class=s1>Wins: 1</span></p><p class=p2><span class=s1>Season 16: Maelyn Jarmon</span></p><p>John hasn’t been a Voice judge for very long, but he was able to win in his first season with season 16’s Maelyn Jarmon. As fans may remember, the season 16 Voice finale also caused a fight between John and his wife, Chrissy Teigen. Long story short, John invited his fellow judges, Blake Shelton, Gwen Stefani and Kelly Clarkson, to dinner at his house but <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">didn’t tell his</a> wife that it was the finale. As expected, she was pissed.</p><h2 class=p2><span class=s1>Christina Aguilera (Season 1 – 3, 5, 8, 10)</span></h2><p class=p2><span class=s1>Wins: 1</span></p><p class=p2><span class=s1>Season 10: Alisan Porter</span></p><p>Christina was one of the four OG Voice judges, but it wasn’t until season 10 that she won for the first time with Alisan Porter. She had been in the finals a few times, but season 10 was her first (and only) win, as that was also her last season.</p><h2 class=p1><span class=s1>Kelly Clarkson (Season 14 – Present)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/the-voice-kelly-clarkson.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>Wins: 3</span></p><p>Kelly may be a newbie to The Voice scene, but she’s proven time and again that she isn’t one to be underestimated. Since she started as judge in season 14 in 2018, Kelly has won three times with Brynn Cartelli (season 14), Chevel Shepherd (season 15) and Jake Hoot (season 17.) Not only was Kelly able to win in her first season, but she has won three times in her five seasons on the show.</p><h2>Adam Levine (Season 1 – 16)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/the-voice-adam-levine.jpg><p>Wins: 3</p><p>While Adam doesn’t have the most wins of The Voice judges, he does hold a record as the first-ever winner of the show. He won season 1 with Javier Colon. Since then, he’s had two more winners: Tessanne Chin (season 5) and Jordan Smith (season 9.) After 16 seasons on the show, Adam left in 2019. However, he will forever be remembered as one of the few judges to give the next coach a run for his money.</p><h2 class=p1><span class=s1>Blake Shelton (Season 1 – Present)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/the-voice-blake-shelton.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>Wins: 6</span></p><p>Those who have watched The Voice in the past nine years know that Blake is a force to be reckoned with. In his 18 seasons on the show, he’s won six (!!!) times: season 2 (Jermaine Paul), season 3 (Cassadee Pope), season 4 (Danielle Bradbery), season 7 (Craig Wayne Boyd), season 11 (Sundance Head) and season 13 (Chloe Kohanski.) Blake has double what other Voice coaches have in terms of wins, and as the only OG to still be a judge on the show, he def has more experience than anyone else in a red swivel chair. However, he hasn’t won in five years, so maybe it’s time for another coach (Kelly?) to take his crown.</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
