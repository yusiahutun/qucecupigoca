letting the thieves at the center of America's most notorious unsolved art crime into the Boston gallery from which they looted paintings worth $500million has spoken of his guilt.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Rick Abath, who was a college drop-out working night shifts at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in 1990, said he still feels 'horrible' about his inadvertent role in the crime, which has baffled investigators for decades.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Abath was duped by two thieves in police uniform, who persuaded him to let them into the gallery, then overwhelmed him and left him in the basement covered in duct tape.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>He spent the next seven hours handcuffed to an electrical box alongside another guard, while the two men cut loose enormously valuable Old Masters from their frames, including works by Rembrandt, Vermeer, Degas and Manet.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>The FBI has never come close to finding the paintings - despite <a style=font-weight:700 rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>supposedly promising leads</a> last May - and there remains a $5million reward for information leading to their return.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Abath reflected on the night of March 18, 1990, in an interview published by <a style=font-weight:700 rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>NPR</a>.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>He said: 'They had hats, badges, they looked like cops, and I let them in...'</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'Ultimately I'm the one who made the decision to buzz them in.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'It's the kind of thing most people don't have to learn to cope with. It's like doing penance. It's always there.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>He added: 'I don't want to be remembered for this alone.
