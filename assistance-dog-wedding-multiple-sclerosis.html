But for some people, pets are more than just a companion – they're a lifeline, as Tracey Kesterton, who has Multiple Sclerosis (MS) explains of her beloved Labrador, Martha, who is such a big part of her life that she had a pivotal role in her ower's wedding day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2dc34b6114e1-assistance-dog-puppies.jpg><p id=e2WnjcrYNmK data-wc=35>"Martha is the world to me, I can't imagine life without her," Tracey tells HELLO! "On the rare occasions we're apart it feels like I've lost a limb. I'm lost without her by my side."</p><p id=e-DzTP9nrjc data-wc=65>"My world is getting more and more difficult due to MS, but Martha doesn't know I'm disabled and helping me is a game to her, picking up the endless things I drop," Tracey continues of Martha's importance in her life. "She's like an extra limb, doing things without being asked much of the time. But she also helps me feel happier, without ever meaning to.</p><p id=erXoUwF9pU data-wc=11><strong>READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>How bold beauty rituals helped me accept my Parkinson's diagnosis</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eokQyDfOa7T data-wc=40>"She needs walking and even if I'm having a down day, she brings me my shoes and looks at me with a 'we ARE going out, aren't we?' expression, which means suddenly we're in the fresh air, talking to people.</p><p id=eWlvunJ2dLx data-wc=29>"She lifts me up, even when I want to curl up and shut the world out.

"She takes the laundry to the washing machine, empties the washing machine, fetches the post, gets things off supermarket shelves and picks up endless things I drop, and even opens and closes doors for me," Tracey shares.</p><p id=eX1NU5B16FB data-wc=37>"MS has restricted me so much nowadays, but Martha keeps me going. She keeps me smiling and I focus on her rather than the restrictive fist that keeps me in a wheelchair all the time," Tracey says.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><p id=eJ5CCBMDWQi data-wc=39>Tracey found Martha through <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Canine Partners</a> and explains that she's seen them change the lives of others, as well as her own. "These amazing dogs let you cling on to your independence for longer, and that's priceless to me.</p><p id=ePOvRKia1AB data-wc=72>"I met a man looking to be matched to his perfect dog at Canine Partners. He looked old and tired and explained that his carer puts him to bed at 9:30pm, despite him not wanting to go to bed then, but it was when she was scheduled to help him. He told me that his dog would mean he could go to bed when he wanted to, helping him rediscover his independence."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/72ef90cc467c-dog-posting-letter.jpg><p id=ermcMz2Kf1_ data-wc=38>Not just a lifeline to Tracey, Martha is part of her family, so when she and her partner Martin Farrant got married this May, there was no question over whether Martha would be involved in the big day.</p><p id=ec6j5EsSNaj data-wc=17><strong>MORE DOGS:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>I tried puppy yoga for the first time to see if it made me happier</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=ey7LPL0DoCw data-wc=52>"Martha and I are rarely apart, so it seemed natural she'd walk beside my wheelchair down the aisle. But when we announced our engagement on Facebook, we were overwhelmed by people asking what Martha would be doing. Our vicar was even secretly hoping for her to have a role in the day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b0deb4888a11-assistance-dog-wedding.jpg><p id=eOMjlUIQL62 data-wc=59>"We decided to give the wedding rings to someone responsible – Martha! We put them in a basket, which she carried beside me down the aisle. Martha had extra training from Canine Partners so she'd know what to do on the big day. She didn't put a paw wrong and I could've cried I was so proud of her!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/dfa98dfde3ae-wedding-assistance-dog.png><h2><strong>How to include your assistance dog in your wedding</strong></h2><p id=encqIAiP7mlX data-wc=36>If you're keen to include your assistance dog in your wedding, Paul Martin from <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Guide Dogs UK</a> spoke to leading wedding planning website <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Hitched&nbsp;</a>about how to thoughtfully include a working dog in your big day.</p><p id=ewdubv743UXU data-wc=50>“Many of our guide dog owners will give their canine partner a starring role in recognition of the special place they have in their life. A bride will often walk down the aisle with her guide dog, whereas a groom may have their assistance dog with them at the altar.</p><p id=e9ijQ7db9FMX data-wc=34>“We’ve seen guide dogs with their harnesses decorated with flower garlands, lace or ribbon to match the colour scheme or even made an honorary bridesmaid. Bandanas and bow ties are also a great choice.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6dc11dce9ec6-help-dog.jpg><p id=e54VEuDk5XEd data-wc=48>“It’s also worth remembering that people with sight loss will very often have friends and family who have sight loss themselves, so there will likely be other guide dogs or retired guide dog guests at the wedding. Getting them all together for a celebratory photograph is a must.</p><p id=ePBUpy7sfhTb data-wc=34>“Just like pet dogs, assistance dogs will need a break during this busy day, and a safe quiet place to be left when the party gets underway if their owner doesn’t need their support.”</p><p id=ecZ02ShW9DHh data-wc=23><strong>To find out more about Canine Partners or to make a donation to help transform the lives of disabled people, please visit <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>caninepartners.org.uk</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaJ%2BemZyptW6tzZ1kn6Gko7K0v45tcHJuZmt8or%2FSoqqtmZ6Ysm6wzqBksJ2Umbavs4ymrKWsmaW5pnnSnKOeqp%2BotrR7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./0-vjxgaedr.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jessica Simpson Abusing Her Breasts, Stuffed in Small Top</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./homemade-versus-store-bought-cheez-its.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Homemade Versus Store-Bought Cheez-Its | First For Women</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amal-clooney-mob-wife-trend-cream-fur-coat.html>Amal Clooney Elevates the Mob Wife Trend in a Cream Fur Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./demolition-underway-at-washington-elementary-davenport.html>Demolition underway at Washington Elementary, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iowa-man-killed-in-head-on-crash.html>Iowa man killed in head-on crash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./style-edit-richard-milles-technically-ambitious-new-rm-30-01-automatic-luxury-watch-was-inspired.html>Style Edit: Richard Milles technically ambitious new RM 30-01 Automatic luxury watch was inspired</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./463481-what-happened-frankie-lons-life-story-death.html>What happened to Frankie Lons?
