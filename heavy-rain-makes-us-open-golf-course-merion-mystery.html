On battered legs, Hogan had to play the 36-hole final, followed by the 18-hole play-off.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"Knowing the fact that he went through the accident and then came out here and played 36 and 18, that's awfully impressive," Woods said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In some small way, Woods can relate.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Five years ago, Woods tried to play the US Open with the ligaments shredded in his left knee and a double stress fracture in his lower left leg. The USGA published a book called , and the photo it selected for the cover showed Woods arching his back and pumping his fists after making a 12-foot birdie on the 72nd hole at Torrey Pines to get into a play-off.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It wouldn't have been much of a photo if he had missed.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Woods had to go 91 holes that week. He had to make another birdie on the 18th hole of the play-off to go extra holes before finally beating Rocco Mediate.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"I think there were a lot of people pulling for Tiger," said Rory McIlroy, who was 19 at the time, a rookie on the European Tour who failed to qualify for the US Open. "He was playing on a broken leg pretty much, so I was definitely pulling for Tiger. It was probably one of the best performances golf has ever seen, if not sport in general."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hard as it might have been to believe that day, it was also the last major Woods won.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The big ones don't come as easily as they once seemed to for Woods, although he never looked at them that way.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"It wasn't ever easy," he said. "I felt it was still difficult because the major of the majors, three of the four always rotated. It was always on a new site each and every year. Augusta was the only one you could rely on from past experiences. A lot of majors that I won were on either the first or second time I'd ever seen it."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Woods won four majors on courses he had never played: Medinah for the 1999 PGA Championship and Valhalla for the PGA Championship the following year, Bethpage Black in the 2002 US Open and Royal Liverpool for the 2006 British Open.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Merion is new not only to him, but just about everyone.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For all the history of the course, this week seems like a recurrence of the troublesome weather that has followed the PGA Tour around this season. It has received more than 120mm of rain since Friday, so much that it was closed for practice one day on the weekend, and play was stopped three times on Monday.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"Played the golf course last Wednesday, which has proved kind of invaluable now," Graeme McDowell said. "I flew in yesterday with the intention of playing 18 holes late last night, but that didn't happen. So I'm kind of adjusting my plan here at the minute. I'm going to play nine holes this afternoon and nine holes tomorrow."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Woods stopped at Merion on the way to the Memorial, and wondered how much he got out of that practice round. It rained practically the entire time, so the ball wasn't flying very far in the air or when it hit the ground. Woods was trying to figure out how much the ball would run along the canted fairways in dry conditions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Now, he might not find out.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"I thought it might be totally different," Woods said. "As I explained at Memorial, I thought the ball would be running out and we would hit different clubs and different shapes. But it's going to be the same as what we played" in his practice round two weeks ago.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Woods has already forgotten about his last start, an abysmal finish at the Memorial where he couldn't make a putt and wound up 20 shots off the lead. He said he had a good week of practice at home in Florida until some tropical weather came through.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"I guess it was getting us ready for this one," he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The preparation is all part of the plan. Woods talked about going to other major courses ahead of time to map out his strategy and get a feel for how to play the course.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"But then I have to go out and execute," he said. "And go out and win an event."</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Rain makes U.S. Open a mystery</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1moKecm3yivtOimqWdX2Z%2FdoWRcW9ooJWWw7p50Zqgp2Wdlrimv4yuqmanoJq7brPOpZ1mm5%2Bqv7SxjKacq6Gfo3quxdKtnKux</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./homemade-versus-store-bought-cheez-its.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Homemade Versus Store-Bought Cheez-Its | First For Women</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./griffin-gluck.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Griffin Gluck Biography, Age, Height, Girlfriend, Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amal-clooney-mob-wife-trend-cream-fur-coat.html>Amal Clooney Elevates the Mob Wife Trend in a Cream Fur Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./demolition-underway-at-washington-elementary-davenport.html>Demolition underway at Washington Elementary, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iowa-man-killed-in-head-on-crash.html>Iowa man killed in head-on crash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./style-edit-richard-milles-technically-ambitious-new-rm-30-01-automatic-luxury-watch-was-inspired.html>Style Edit: Richard Milles technically ambitious new RM 30-01 Automatic luxury watch was inspired</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./463481-what-happened-frankie-lons-life-story-death.html>What happened to Frankie Lons?
