It features a remote community located in the northwest corner of the vast ice-capped landscape. After a two-year-long gap, the series returned with a few changes, first with its name (<i>Life Below Zero: Port Protection</i>) and the absence of a few cast members. One of the missing faces that fans had gradually gotten used to seeing was Amanda Maker. So, what happened to Amanda on Port Protection?

That is why fans were disappointed by the absence of Amanda, who showed excellent survival skills. So, where is Amanda Maker from <i>Port Protection</i> today?</p><h2>What is Port Protection all about?</h2><p class=align-left><i>Port Protection</i> is a reality television show that follows a group of individuals living in a remote, fog-shrouded<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> community of Port Protection</a>. Port Protection is in the northwest corner of Prince Wales Island, Alaska. The region is surrounded by the freezing waters of the North Pacific.</p><p class=align-left>Port Protection has approximately 100 residents that push the limits of survival by hunting, fishing, trapping, growing their food and building shelter. On top of this, the region has no government or law enforcement, making their living conditions even more dangerous.</p><p class=align-left>The cast and people living in the region consider the risk is worth the big reward of a world with community <a href=#>security</a> without the limitations of bureaucracy.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/489f25ced70f18ae.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Gary Muehlberger: Life story and cause of death</span></p></a><h2>What happened to Amanda from Port Protection?</h2><p class=align-left>After the culmination of the <a href=#>television</a> show's second season in 2016, the franchise came back with a spin-off series called <i>Life Below Zero</i> in 2018. It wasn't until 2020, that <i>Port Protection</i> returned to National Geographic albeit with a new name, <i>Life Below Zero: Port Protection</i>. Other notable changes during its return were the absence of Amanda Maker and other outstanding cast members.</p><p class=align-left>Even though Amanda Makar from <i>Port Protection</i> said her farewell at the end of season 2, fans hoped she would return in the upcoming season. The survivalist became a fan favourite because of her impressive survival tactics in the Alaskan wild. In addition, she came out as extraordinarily independent and robust.</p><p class=align-left>People loved her story as she was, in the beginning, perceived as a rookie. Her unique situation made her more relatable, winning many fans hearts along the way. However, her departure from the show without a clear explanation from National Geographic left fans devastated.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/544bad48a42792ec.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Will Willis from Forged in Fire? Everything you should know</span></p></a><p class=align-left>It was hard figuring out the primary reason for Amanda’s departure. The <a href=#>show</a> is about individuals moving out to live in a remote location in the middle of nowhere with numerous hardships. Of course, the situation doesn't conform to regular social rules, and an exit from the remote site wouldn't be shocking.</p><p class=align-left>Her possible reason for leaving might have been that she was tired of living in the wild and being followed by cameras everywhere she went. Also, there is a possibility that a contract dispute resulted in her departure.</p><p class=align-left>In 2020, the popular television station broke its silence in an interview with Reality Blurred. Although they <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">did not mention specifics</a>, the company stated that many people moved away from Alaska in between filming. The great news is that although many leave, a similar number of people come to the town and settle.</p><h2>Is Amanda Makar still in Port Protection?</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/41c47dc32c3574ce.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Survivor pay per episode: How much do the contestants get paid?</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8af0af086944015f.jpeg><p class=align-left>She is not part of the reality TV show and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">left after the end of the second season</a>. When the National Geographic television show returned in 2020 for the third instalment, many of the previous cast was missing, including Amanda. Therefore, she is no longer featured on the show and would probably appear if she is recalled.</p><h2>is Amanda Makar married?</h2><p class=align-left>Unfortunately, there isn't much information on Amanda Maker besides what fans enjoyed on the reality television show. Therefore, it is hard to know if the reality TV star that gained acknowledgement for being a survivalist is married or not.</p><h2>Port Protection Alaska cast today</h2><p class=align-left>The show returned in 2020 with a fantastic cast that includes:</p><ul><li>Timothy “Curly” Reach</li><li>Sam Carlson</li><li>Mary Miller</li><li>Stuart Andrews</li><li>David squib</li><li>Matt Carlson</li><li>Kaley Burke</li><li>Christina Jackson</li></ul><h2>What Port Protection Alaska cast member has died?</h2><p class=align-left>Fortunately, no <i>Port Protection</i> cast member dies during the show's filming. But, unfortunately, one of the show's favourites, <a href=#>Gary Muehlberger</a>, died on March 19, 2021. He lived in the wild, perfecting his self-subsistence techniques in Alaska for more than 39 years.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6e104d6ff716f15b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Maine Cabin Masters cast net worth and salary per episode</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Many fans have wondered what happened to Amanda on <i>Port Protection</i>, considering her departure after the second season. It seems like the production crew refreshed and came with a new cast, probably because of unavoidable circumstances.</p><p class=align-left><i>Shark Tank</i> is a fantastic television show that features entrepreneurs trying to win the heart of big investors referred to as the sharks. The story of Cup Board Pro stood out, and people are wondering what happened to them after bagging the investment they were looking for. <a href=#>Tuko.co.ke</a> featured an exciting <a href=#>piece</a> about their story, giving great details about their progress.</p><p class=align-left>The investment gave them a considerable boost, and <a href=#>business</a> progressed well, even selling all of their dad's inventory within minutes.
