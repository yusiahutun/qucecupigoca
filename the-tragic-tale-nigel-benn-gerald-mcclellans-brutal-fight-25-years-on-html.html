Until such time, hopefully, as McClellan is able to answer for himself, witness this Saturday night the figure of Michael Watson paying rapt attention at ringside to the ferocious manner of combat which has left him in a wheelchair.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Significantly, the surgeon whose swift incisions have given McClellan his chances of survival and a normal life declines to add his voice to the ban-boxing lobby. 'I personally do not think boxing should be banned,' Dr John Sutcliffe said yesterday.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Rather, Sutcliffe is at work with the official commission which has put in place the procedures of urgency which gave McClellan oxygen and time to reach hospital still alive. It is violently disturbing when a young man is reduced to such a fragile hold on life by the very nature of his sport.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The British Boxing Board of Control maintain that to outlaw pugilism would serve only to drive it underground, to a dark place where none of their safeguards exist. That is a powerful argument but it it is not the real point. It is useless to deny that the object of boxing is to render another human being senseless.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Especially futile after watching a fight like this one which stands historic comparison with the best of the Ali-Frazier trilogy and which began with a first round as viciously intense as the opening three minutes of Hagler-Hearns and ended with a 10th round as brutally climactic as Holyfield-Bowe. The real point is that it would diminish the human spirit to prohibit men bursting with such challenging aggression from fighting.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Neither McClellan, who revels in the ferocity of his pit-bull terriers, nor Benn, who rages against the outside world, would make welcome dinner guests for the politicians or the do-gooders who are in the vanguard of the abolitionists. Civilised society might care to consider how much of a danger to civilised society such men - including one Michael Gerard Tyson who is to due to be returned to civilised society shortly - might be if they were denied self-expression in the ring.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>To cast the likes of McClellan and Benn as hungry victims of vile exploitation is as outdated as the cheapest of the old black-and-white boxing movies. Both were millionaires before this weekend. Neither needed the extra half-million pounds or more they were paid for scrambling each other's faculties in the Docklands area of east London where the hardest fights used to take place in the old dark streets, not the shiny Arena.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>They were contesting a world championship by name - the WBC super-middleweight title - but declaring their pride and manhood by nature. It is not easy to explain this to the tea-set, cafe society or the chattering classes. The sheer, raw, primitive instinct which brought Benn back through the ropes between which he was bludgeoned in the first minute, carried him on through hellish punishment, then lifted him up off the canvas to which he was battered in the eighth round, has nothing to do with the money, greed and corruption with which boxing is so often associated.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>This was a fundamental of human nature to which society would close off this outlet to its own peril and detriment. In its base form these gladiators embody the daring which enabled mankind to cross oceans, climb mountains, walk on the moon... challenge all the frontiers. McClellan and Benn are not victims but heroes. Brutal, ugly perhaps, tragic possibly, but heroes just the same. Ban boxing and next the prohibitionists will be after racing by horse and motor, round-the-world sailing, football of any shape and code, cricket with a hard ball, street crossing and Bingo in case we get too excited.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Excitement, in its roaring manifestation, was the initial emotion aroused by Benn as he defied the 40-1 odds and took most of the chin-breaking punishment to come back and beat one of the most dangerous men in this bloody business and thereby claim his place in the pantheon of great middleweights. Chris Eubank, eat your heart out. Eubank, who prefers a blander diet of opponent, was not at ringside. But Bruno and Lewis, Cooper and McGuigan were there along with Watson and Warren, all punching the air in unashamed lust for Benn's achievement of the seemingly impossible.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>This was boxing at its finest, no matter how animal the passions it aroused. It was pure excitement. Although it was curtailed by the anxiety which then emanated from McClellan's slump into his corner - and even though Benn himself is traumatised by his opponent's plight - it ought not to be contaminated by feelings of guilt. Not since the Marquis of Queensberry framed his rules for civilised fisticuffs 111 years ago has boxing been so prepared to render humane assistance to the men who take its highest of sporting risks.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Although it was Benn's face which became distorted by a fractured jaw - whoever accused him of being chinny? - it was McClellan who was suffering the more lasting internal damage. As Benn unbalanced himself completely with one desperate swing against the points mounting in his opponent's favour, McClellan dropped oddly to one knee and gestured to his forehead.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>We thought he might be protesting about an imagined butt but most likely he was feeling the first affects of cerebral bleeding. That was in the ninth round. Twice more in the 10th he fell to his knees, as much the victim of the affliction within his brain as of the right-hand punches for which Benn had found the strength from somewhere.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The great fight was over, the more important fight for life just beginning. As the ambulances took over the bell ringing it was time not only to worry for these men but to salute them. Gerald McClellan and Nigel Benn, in the highest traditions of the ring, had fought each other to a standstill. Hopefully not to a finish.</p>&lt;!- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/us/sport/boxing/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - -><span class=mol-ads-label-container><span class=mol-ads-label>Advertisement</span></span><h2>RELATED ARTICLES</h2><ul class="rotator-pages link-xocc"><li class=rotator-prev><a href=# data-page=prev>Previous</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=1>1</a></li><li class=rotator-next><a href=# data-page=next>Next</a></li></ul><ul class="rotator-panels link-bogr1 linkro-ccox"><li><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/02/25/09/25162294-0-image-m-13_1582621738355.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Deontay Wilder SACKS the experienced trainer who threw in...</span></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/02/25/09/25162900-0-image-m-19_1582622107538.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Tyson Fury waves to his fans and his wife Paris shows off...</span></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/02/24/21/25140442-0-image-m-38_1582581090070.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>MARTIN SAMUEL: Fleet-footed Tyson Fury broke the mould in...</span></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/02/24/12/25114340-0-image-m-25_1582547342459.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Deontay Wilder is set to take Tyson Fury into a trilogy,...</span></a></li></ul><h2>Share this article</h2><span class=wai>Share</span> <span>241</span> shares<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKugpL%2B1e8Gor6Kml2Sus8DInKOeZWhlgXKElmpmjaCVYsGzrcaimmaskaGybprIoJylZXKau695pp6pmqSUYpqkj8ueo6WZnqh6o77UrZilZZaetKnAjGtsZrGVlr%2B0ec6nZaGsnaE%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./george-clooney-and-amal-alamuddins-wedding-in-pictures.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>George Clooney and Amal Alamuddin's Wedding in Pictures</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ryan-webber-is-new-head-coach-for-bettendorf-high-girls-basketball.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ryan Webber is new head coach for Bettendorf High girls basketball</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amal-clooney-mob-wife-trend-cream-fur-coat.html>Amal Clooney Elevates the Mob Wife Trend in a Cream Fur Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./demolition-underway-at-washington-elementary-davenport.html>Demolition underway at Washington Elementary, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iowa-man-killed-in-head-on-crash.html>Iowa man killed in head-on crash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./style-edit-richard-milles-technically-ambitious-new-rm-30-01-automatic-luxury-watch-was-inspired.html>Style Edit: Richard Milles technically ambitious new RM 30-01 Automatic luxury watch was inspired</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./463481-what-happened-frankie-lons-life-story-death.html>What happened to Frankie Lons?
